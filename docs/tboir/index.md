# The Binding of Isaac Repentance

Experience the modern classic, The Binding of Isaac, like you&#x27;ve never seen it before. 
It&#x27;s a game too big to be called a sequel: Repentance takes Isaac to new heights of 
roguelike dungeon adventure, as the brave boy descends into the basement for his 
greatest challenge yet! Isaac&#x27;s new quest takes him to unknown places he&#x27;s never been, 
filled with horrible new enemies and bosses, weapon combos you&#x27;ve never synergized 
before and items he&#x27;s never seen... unholy terrors from his wildest dreams and worst 
nightmares!
