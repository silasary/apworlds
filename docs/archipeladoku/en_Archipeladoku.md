# Archipeladoku

## Where is the options page?

https://galdiuz.github.io/archipeladoku/Archipeladoku.yaml


## What does randomization do to this game?

Archipeladoku is Sudoku for Archipelago. You start with one board, and more
boards have to be unlocked one block at a time.


## What items and locations get shuffled?

Each solved row, column, block, or entire board is a location. The blocks you
have to unlock are your items, along with some potentially useful filler items
that can help you solve the puzzles.
