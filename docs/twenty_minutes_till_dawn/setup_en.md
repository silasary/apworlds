## Game Setup Instructions
No manual mod installation or other configuration is required to play 20 Minutes Till Dawn with Archipelago. The client included with the APWorld does all the work by attaching to the game process and monitoring and manipulating the game state in real-time.

**IMPORTANT**

Once the Archipelago client is connected, a hook will be set up in the game's memory to allow the client to safely call game functions from the main thread. _**If the client is ever closed, 20 Minutes Till Dawn will NEED to be restarted before connecting another client**_ for everything to function as expected. If you don't restart the game, the previous hook will remain installed with no way for the new client to detect and use it.
