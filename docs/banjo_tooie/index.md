# Banjo Tooie

Banjo-Tooie is a single-player platform game in which the protagonists are controlled from a third-person perspective.
Carrying over most of the mechanics and concepts established in its predecessor,
the game features three-dimensional worlds consisting of various platforming challenges and puzzles, with a notable
increased focus on puzzle-solving over the worlds of Banjo-Kazooie.
