# Cassette Beasts Setup Guide

## Installation

All releases can be found in the [APCB Github Releases page](https://github.com/sitskin/apCassetteBeasts/releases).
Follow the install instructions found in the release.

## Setup AP connection

On the Cassette Beasts launch screen you will see all of the mods that you have installed, if you do not see the archipelago companion mod as a part of that list then double check that all of the install steps have been completed.  You can also go to the Cassette Beasts channel in the Archipelago discord.

Prior to starting a new file you will want to go into settings and cycle all the way through to the end where there is a new tab for AP.  This is where all of the archipelago settings live.  
The Host input is where you will put the address and port of your server, which if hosted on the archipelago site will look something like `archipelago.gg:123456`.
The Player input is the name that you set as part of the yaml settings.  This must match exactly to what the server thinks your player name is.
The Password input can be left blank if there is not a password configured for the server.  The vast majority will not utilize the password field.
Under the password input there are connect and disconnect buttons, they will do basically exactly what you expect of them.  If you are not currently connected then the disconnect button will be disabled, and similarly if you are currently connected the connect button will be disabled.
Finally there is the status text that helps you know which step of the process you are currently in.  The two main states are "Disconnected", which is shown when you are not connected, and "Connected to multiworld", which is shown when you have successfully connected to the server and associated yourself to the slot for your player.

## Starting a new game
Now that you have successfully connected to the server you can leave the settings section.  Back on the main menu you can press play and that will bring you to your list of files.  When you have the archipelago mod installed we alter the location of the games saves, so do not be alarmed if you do not see any of your vanila saves in the list.  You can access them again by removing the AP mod.
From here you can start a new game just like you normally would.  There are some roadblocks put in place to try and keep people from starting a new game without first connecting, as you do not get access to the settings again until after the tutorial, but they are not fool proof.
We have skipped the vast majority of the tutorial in the AP.  The reasoning behind this was that the player is very quickly blocked by both the harbourtown gate key and glide as a part of the quest.  Skipping to after the "Old Morgante" fight allows for more immediate freedom, the elevator is working, and keeps you from having to play through the somewhat slow tutorial every time.

## Returning to a game
Returning to a game is very similar to starting a new one.  We have similar roadblocks put in place to try and make sure that not only are you connected, but that you are connected to the same server that the game was started on, just in case you are running multiple worlds at the same time.
