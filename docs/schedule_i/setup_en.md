## How to play

First, you need a room to connect to. For this, you or someone you know has to generate a game.  
This will not be explained here,
but you can check the [Archipelago Setup Guide](/tutorial/Archipelago/setup_en#generating-a-game).

You also need to have [Archipelago](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases/latest) installed
and the [The Schedule I apworld](https://github.com/MacH8s/Narcopelago/releases/latest) installed into Archipelago.

### Install Mod

Install Thunderstore Mod Manager and open it.
Choose Schedule I and make a profile for Archipelago, name it whatever you like.
Search for 'Narcopelago' in the mod search and install it.
From there you can launch the game as Modded on the top right and your install has been complete! You must launch the game this way every time you want to play Archipelago.

### Joining Game

Use In-Game UI to connect to server. Once connected, Create a new world and skip the prologue.
Make sure to save as often as you can, and you are able to rejoin. Restart your game if you need to rejoin the world!
If you want to play with friends (Untested): Invite them to your lobby. All of you connect as same archipelago Info, Load into world.

## Switching Rooms
Restart your game to switch rooms. There may be some issues if you don't do so even if it shows things are working.
