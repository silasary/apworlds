# Zork Grand Inquisitor

Zork: Grand Inquisitor is a 1997 point-and-click adventure game for PC.
Magic has been banned from the great Underground Empire of Zork. By edict of the Grand Inquisitor Mir Yannick, the
Empire has been sealed off and the practice of mystic arts declared punishable by &quot;Totemization&quot; (a very bad thing).
The only way to restore magic to the kingdom is to find three hidden artifacts: The Coconut of Quendor, The Cube of
Foundation, and The Skull of Yoruk.
