# Zork Grand Inquisitor

## Randomizer Summary

A majority of inventory items you can normally pick up are completely removed from the game (e.g. the lantern won't be in the crate, the mead won't be at the fish market, etc.). Instead, these items will be distributed in the multiworld. This means that you can expect to access areas and be in a position to solve certain puzzles in a completely different order than you normally would.

Subway, teleporter and totemizer destinations are initially locked and need to be unlocked by receiving the corresponding item in the multiworld. This alone enables creative routing in a game that would otherwise be rather linear.

Important hotspots can also optionally be randomized. This means that you will be unable to interact with certain objects until you receive the corresponding item in the multiworld. This can be a bit confusing at first, but it adds depth to the randomization and makes the game more interesting to play once you master it.

Location checks are granted for the following actions:

- Solving puzzles
- Accessing certain areas for the first time
- Triggering certain unique interactions, even if they aren't puzzles per se
- Looking at certain documents
- Visiting landmarks (Optional; Landmarksanity option)
- Dying in unique ways (Optional; Deathsanity option)

## Tracking

### In-Client Trackers
The client that ships with the APWorld includes 2 trackers. All tracker state is persisted server-side and will be fully available for whoever connects to the slot. Having and launching the game is not mandatory to look at the in-client trackers.

First, a typical item / location tracker. It has a unique feature where instead of showing every location in logic instantly, you will need to have gained access to an area in the game before seeing if any of its locations are available to check. This allows for a more focused experience and, perhaps more importantly, will not spoil any entrance randomizer destinations.

If you ever need to know how to check any location in the game, you can click the ? button on the left of any location name to get a full explanation.

Finally, for those braving the entrance randomizer, a fully automated entrance tracker is available. As you go through any entrance in the game, its destination will be permanently annotated in the tracker!


### Universal Tracker
The APWorld is also fully compatible with Universal Tracker. It is a YAML-free implementation (i.e. you don't need to have the YAML used to generate in your Players directory). It also includes a map view for a more visual tracking experience.
