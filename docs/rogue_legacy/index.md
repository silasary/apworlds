# Rogue Legacy

Rogue Legacy is a genealogical rogue-&quot;LITE&quot; where anyone can be a hero. Each time you die, your child will succeed
you. Every child is unique. One child might be colorblind, another might have vertigo-- they could even be a dwarf.
But that&#x27;s OK, because no one is perfect, and you don&#x27;t have to be to succeed.
