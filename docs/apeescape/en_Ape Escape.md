# Ape Escape

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Access to levels is determined by World Keys instead of the standard progression of catching enough monkeys in a level.
Which entrance leads to which level can also be randomized.
Gadgets are shuffled throughout the multiworld instead of being unlocked at specific points, optionally including the
Time Net and Water Net.
"Specter Token" items can also be included to unlock the chosen goal boss (Specter in either Monkey Madness or Peak
Point Matrix) or as the goal.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

The Stun Club, Monkey Radar, Slingback Shooter, Super Hoop, Sky Flyer, RC Car and Magic Punch are always shuffled.
The Time Net and Water Net can also be shuffled.
The door to the second half of Monkey Madness is also always an item, instead of its vanilla requirement.
Monkey Lamps can also be shuffled, unlocking their doors on receiving an item instead of catching enough monkeys.
World Keys unlock access to 1, 2 or 3 levels, depending on the options chosen. These can also be turned off.
Specter Tokens can also be created, as an optional requirement for goal, similar to a Triforce Hunt.
Energy Chips, special pellets, Cookies and even Jackets fill the rest of the item pool.

Monkeys and non-goal bosses are always locations.
Specter Coins and Mailboxes can optionally be included as locations. The mailboxes in the gadget training rooms are
not included in this due to technical limitations with the gadget training.
Even if Mailbox Shuffle is turned off, the Time Station mailboxes will be included if the Time Net is shuffled.

## How do I check my settings?

The mailbox in the center of the Time Station contains a lot of useful information about the seed, including logic
difficulties and included tricks, what remote doors are open, and how many Specter Tokens are needed or found.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

A gadget will be added to the inventory, a level or door will be unlocked, or a consumable will be given.
Optionally, a message will be sent as a BizHawk message, displayed over the emulator window.
There is currently no other in-game indication or sound effect on receiving an item.
