### Tips
- Start with simple pieces to build up your item pool
- Combos give bonus points - try to clear multiple lines/boxes at once
- Larger pieces score more but are harder to place
- The 9x9 grid with 3x3 boxes gives the highest scoring potential
- Save your abilities for when you really need them!
