# Secret of Mana

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

It puts stuff in random spots and makes you do the thing.

The thing depends on the goal option.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

Characters, Spells, weapons, weapon orbs, mana seeds, gold tower key, sea hare tail, moogle belt, midge mallet and
optionally Flammie Drum are put into random spots.

Possible spots are boss rewards, mana seed pedestals, some NPCs and chests.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any of the items which can be shuffled may also be placed in another player's world. Specific items can be limited to
your own world using plando.

## What does another world's item look like in Secret of Mana?

It may show a message when checking a location.

## What happens when the player receives an item?

When the player receives an item, a popup will appear to show which item was received. Items won't be received while a
script is active or during boss fights. Once all scripts have ended, items will be received in order.
