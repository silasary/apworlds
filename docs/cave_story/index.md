# Cave Story

You wake up in a dark cave with no memory of who you are, where you came from
or why you&#x27;re in such a place. Uncovering Mimiga Village you discover that the
once-carefree Mimigas are in danger at the hands of a maniacal scientist. Run,
jump, shoot, fly and explore your way through a massive action-adventure
reminiscent of classic 8- and 16-bit games. Take control and learn the origins
of this world&#x27;s power, stop the delusional villain and save the Mimiga!
