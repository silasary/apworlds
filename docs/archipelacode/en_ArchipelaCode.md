# ArchipelaCode

## What is ArchipelaCode?

ArchipelaCode is an implementation of LeetCode problems for Archipelago created by ShackledMars261.
It tasks you with solving a random selection of (free) programming problems. However, you must unlock various "language features", including variable declaration, if statements, comparison operators, and more.

NOTE: ArchipelaCode is currently on v0.0.1 (at the time of writing this). THERE WILL BE BUGS! I've played through a few Multiworlds by myself with no major errors, but I'm sure you will find some. If you do find one, please ping me (@ShackledMars261) in the [ArchipelaCode post](https://discord.com/channels/731205301247803413/1409443049381040128) inside of [#future-game-design](https://discord.com/channels/731205301247803413/1009608126321922180) in the [Archipelago Discord server](https://discord.gg/archipelago).

## What are the items?

"Language Features" like variable declaration, comparison operators, arithmetic operators, for loops, etc. need to be unlocked in order for you to use them. In addition, there are also 4 "Progressive Problem Unlocks", with each one unlocking 20% of the problems. (You start with 20% unlocked.)

## Where is the game client?

The ArchipelaCode client takes the form of a [Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ShackledMars261.archipelacode), allowing you to connect to Archipelago, submit problems to LeetCode, and more, all from inside VS Code.

## What is the end goal?

Solve a certain percentage of your total problems. The percentage defaults to 80, and can be configured in your config file.

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a config file.

## I found a solution to a problem that UT said I shouldn't have been able to!

Congrats! It was rather difficult to figure out how to do the logic for this APWorld, so I ended up making a scraper to get a list of all LeetCode problems and example solutions for them. Feel free to send your solution my way in the channel in the [Archipelago Discord server](https://discord.gg/archipelago), and I'll update the example solutions.
