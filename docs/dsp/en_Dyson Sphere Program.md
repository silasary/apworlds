# Dyson Sphere Program

This multiworld is a very early alpha version for Dyson Sphere Program (DSP).

## Where is the options page?

No options are currently available. The YAML has the default Archipelago options, but none have been tested yet.
If you do end up testing any, please let us know about the results in the DSP thread in the Archipelago Discord.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Currently, the only thing randomized is the research (tech + upgrades) rewards.
When you complete a research, you will receive no rewards, and instead check a location in the multiworld.
Other players will send you items, which are the research rewards you would normally get.
The items you receive will be random research rewards from the pool of all research rewards in the game.

## What is the goal for this multiworld?

The goal is to complete the "Mission Completed!" achievement, which is obtained by completing the main storyline of the game.
