your job is to build production lines and defenses to survive, maintain and conquer.
There are a total of eight different categories of structures to build, varying from
drills and factories to extract and refine resources, to turrets and walls to defend your assets.
There are many more buildings that help to take back Serpulo and other planets. the two current
planets are; Serpulo and Erikir, Serpulo is the home planet of your faction; the Sharded,
brought to defend the planet from the formidable enemy; the Crux. The second planet of Erikir
has a far different and far more deadly enemy of Malis, and their strategies reflect such.
