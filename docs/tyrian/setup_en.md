# APTyrian Setup Guide

## Required Software

- [Archipelago](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases)

- [APTyrian](https://github.com/KScl/TyrianArchipelago/releases)

- One of the following:
  - [Tyrian 2.1](https://www.camanis.net/tyrian/tyrian21.zip) data files
  - [Tyrian 2000](https://www.camanis.net/tyrian/tyrian2000.zip) data files
  - Alternatively, data files from the [GOG.com](https://www.gog.com/en/game/tyrian_2000) version of the game

## Installing APTyrian

1. Download the version of [APTyrian](https://github.com/KScl/TyrianArchipelago/releases) for your operating system,
   and extract it. Windows and Linux (Debian-based distros, specifically) are officially supported.
2. Create a /data/ subfolder inside of the APTyrian subfolder, and copy or extract the data files from either Tyrian
   2.1 or Tyrian 2000 into that folder.

## Joining a MultiWorld Game

1. Launch APTyrian.
2. In the main menu, select "Start Game".
3. Choose "Online via Archipelago Server".
4. Enter the address of the Archipelago server, and your slot name.
5. Choose "Connect to Server", and enjoy.

To continue a game, follow these same steps. Your progress is automatically saved each time you return to the main
game menu, and when you leave the game.

## In-Game Text Client

APTyrian contains a fully-featured text client available from within the game. To bring it up, press the TAB key while
in the main game menu; "[TAB]" will be shown in the bottom-right corner when it is available. From there, you may chat
with other players on the server, `!hint` for items, `!release` or `!collect` after finishing, etc.
