# Lunacid

Lunacid is a first person dungeon crawler inspired by old FROMSOFT games like Shadow Tower and King’s Field.

Long ago a great beast arose from the sea and covered the earth in a poison fog. Now those deemed undesirable
are thrown into a great well, which has become a pit of chaos and disease. You awaken in a moonlit subterranean world,
having been thrown into the Great Well for crimes unknown. The only way out is to go further down and confront the
sleeping old one below. On the way there will be many creatures and secrets to discover.
