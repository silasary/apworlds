# West of Loathing

Say howdy to West of Loathing -- a single-player slapstick comedy adventure role-playing game set in the wild west 
of the Kingdom of Loathing universe. Traverse snake-infested gulches, punch skeletons wearing cowboy hats, grapple 
with demon cows, and investigate a wide variety of disgusting spittoons. Explore a vast open world and encounter a 
colorful cast of characters, some of whom are good, many of whom are bad, and a few of whom are ugly.
