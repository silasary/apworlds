## What is this game?

Garfield Kart - Furious Racing is a remaster of the original Garfield Kart, released on Steam. It's a kart racer akin to games like Mario Kart, with a lot of jank, and a whole lotta lasagna!

## What does randomization do to this game?

Currently there's a number of things that can be randomized, with more to come in the future.
Here is what can be randomized:
- Cups
- Individual Courses
- Spoilers/Hats
- Items
- Puzzle Pieces

## What Garfield Kart - Furious Racing items can appear in other players' worlds?
Anything you choose to randomize in the game will be sent out to the multiworld, so you'll need to be sent new courses, puzzle pieces, items to use, spoilers/hats, and cups, depending on your settings.

## Where is the options page?
Currently, there is no options page. You can download the latest apworlds yaml and the apworld to play [on the latest release](https://github.com/FeluciaPS/Archipelago/releases) and configure it to with the options you'd like.
