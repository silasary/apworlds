# Garfield Kart - Furious Racing Randomizer Setup Guide

## Required Software

- [Garfield Kart - Furious Racing on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1085510/Garfield_Kart__Furious_Racing/)
- For easy setup (recommended):
  - [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/garfield-kart-furious-racing/p/ebkr/r2modman/) OR [Thunderstore Mod Manager](https://www.overwolf.com/app/Thunderstore-Thunderstore_Mod_Manager)
- For manual setup:
  - [BepInEx](https://thunderstore.io/c/garfield-kart-furious-racing/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack/)
  - [GarfieldKartArchipelago](https://thunderstore.io/c/garfield-kart-furious-racing/p/Jeffdev/GarfieldKartArchipelago/)

## Installation
Before starting the installation process, here's what you should know:
- It is strongly recommended to use a mod manager if you want a quicker and easier installation process, but if you don't like installing extra software and are comfortable moving files around, you can refer to the manual setup guide instead.

### Easy setup (mod manager)
1. Download [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/garfield-kart-furious-racing/p/ebkr/r2modman/) using the "Manual Download" button, then install it using the executable in the downloaded zip package (You can also use [Thunderstore Mod Manager](https://www.overwolf.com/app/Thunderstore-Thunderstore_Mod_Manager) which works the same, but it requires [Overwolf](https://www.overwolf.com/))
2. Open the mod manager and select Garfield Kart - Furious Racing in the game selection screen.
3. Select the default profile or create a new one.
4. Open the `Online` tab on the left, then search for `GarfieldKartArchipelago`.
5. Expand GarfieldKartArchipelago and click the `Download` button to install the latest version and all its dependencies.
6. Click `Start Modded` to open the game with the mods (a console should appear if everything was done correctly).

### Manual setup
1. Download the following mods using the `Manual Download` button:
    - [BepInEx](https://thunderstore.io/c/garfield-kart-furious-racing/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack/)
    - [GarfieldKartArchipelago](https://thunderstore.io/c/garfield-kart-furious-racing/p/Jeffdev/GarfieldKartArchipelago/)
2. Open your Garfield Kart - Furious Racing installation directory. On Steam, you can find it easily by right-clicking the game and clicking `Manage` > `Browse local files`.
3. Open the BepInEx pack zip file, then open the `BepInExPack` folder.
4. Drag all folders and files located inside the `BepInExPack` folder and drop them in your Garfield Kart: Furious Racing directory.
5. Open the `BepInEx` folder in your Garfield Kart - Furious Racing directory.
6. Open the GarfieldKartArchipelago zip file.
7. Drag and drop the `plugins` folder in the `BepInEx` folder to fuse with the existing `plugins` folder.
8. Open the game normally to play with mods (if BepInEx was installed correctly, a console should appear).

## Joining a new MultiWorld Game
1. After opening the game, you should see a window show up to type in your connection info and slot name and such.
3. Enter the address (typically archipelago.gg) and port, and then your slot name, then press the `Connect` button.
4. If successful, a popup will appear saying "Connected to Archipelago". If not, a red error message will appear in the connection window.
5. You will now be all set to start playing! You can redo these steps every time you start playing to connect easily each time.
6. If you happen to disconnect for any reason, you can press "F1" to re-open the window and reconnect.

## Troubleshooting
### The game opens normally, and no connection window appears
If the new menu mentioned previously doesn't appear, it can be one of two issues:
 - If there was no console appearing when opening the game, this means the mods didn't load correctly. Here's what you can try:
   - If you are using the mod manager, make sure to open it and press `Start Modded`. Opening the game normally from Steam won't load any mods.
   - Check if the mod manager correctly found the game path. In the mod manager, click `Settings` then go to the `Locations` tab. Make sure the path listed under `Change Garfield Kart - Furious Racing directory` is correct. You can verify the real path if you right-click the game on steam and click `Manage` > `Browse local files`. If the path is wrong, click that setting and change the path.
   - If you installed the mods manually, this usually means BepInEx was not correctly installed. Make sure to read the installation guide carefully.
   - If there is still no console when opening the game modded, try asking in the [Archipelago Discord Server](https://discord.gg/8Z65BR2) for help, by going to [the Garfield Kart - Furious Racing thread](https://discord.com/channels/731205301247803413/1315673680155639848).
 - If there is a console, this means the mods loaded but the GarfieldKartArchipelago mod wasn't found or had errors while loading.
   - Look in the console and make sure you can find a message about the GarfieldKartArchipelago mod being loaded.
   - If you see any red text, there was an error. Report the issue in the [Archipelago Discord Server](https://discord.gg/8Z65BR2), by going to [the Garfield Kart - Furious Racing thread](https://discord.com/channels/731205301247803413/1315673680155639848).
