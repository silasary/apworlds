# Sonic Dreams Collection

In 2013 hacker supergroup “Arcane Kid$” acquired a SEGA DREAMCAST developer kit from ebay.com.
Deep in the filescape they unearthed a note from the director of MJSTUDIO,
a “message in a bottle” detailing the work of SEGA&#x27;s top secret studio which was re-invisioning the future of video gaming.
The Arcane Kid$ salvaged FOUR playable prototypes, some concept art, and countless top-secret SEGA files.
“SEGA squandered MJSTUDIO&#x27;s gift to the world… and dissed Sonic fans globally… by burying these games” Arcane Kid$ spokesperson Jo says.
“It&#x27;s time to set them free.”
