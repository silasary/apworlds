# Sonic Dreams Collection (PC)

## What does Archipelago do to Sonic Dreams Collection?

### GENERAL
- Access to the various games in the collection are behind items. 
	- You will recieve either *Make My Sonic* or *My Roommate Sonic* to start with.
- Access to SegaNet is behind the *SegaNet Adapter* item. 
	- *You do not need to open a SegaNet server instance alongside the game;* a connection will be "faked" once the item is unlocked.
### MAKE MY SONIC
- Every menu item is a check.
- Every upload to SegaNet is a check. 
	- You will need *SegaNet Accounts* to upload to SegaNet, see EGGMAN ORIGIN below.
### SONIC MOVIE MAKER
- Access to each individual stage is an item.
	- The DLC stage is unlocked normally, and will be in logic when *My Roommate Sonic* is unlocked.
- Obtaining the level's camera and finishing the level is a check.
- Access to the Fuckball can also be given as an item.
- (Optional) Every photoshoot background in Stage 2 can be a check.
- (Optional) Every item given to Sonic in Stage 4 can be a check.
- (Optional) Every object released by Sonic in Stage 5 can be a check.
- (Optional) Every Eggy that can be interacted with can be a check.
### MY ROOMMATE SONIC
- Every major progression of the story is a check.
- (Optional) Minor progressions of the story can also be checks.
### EGGMAN ORIGIN
- As with the vanilla game, you will need the *SegaNet Adapter* item to get past the title screen.
- To start a game, you will need a *SegaNet Account*. The amount in the pool is determined by your YAML.
- In order to ascend, you will need 6 *Robust Worm* items. These are your main macguffins to progress.
	- Robust Worms *do not* carry over between accounts. You will need 6 unique Robust Worm items per SegaNet account.
	- If you do not have enough Robust Worms to feed the Egg Baby, the Heron will be unable to pick up new Robust Worms.
- Feeding the Egg Baby a Robust Worm is a check, alongside ascensions themselves.
    - The amount of Robust Worms you have fed to the Egg Baby is saved to your Archipelago slot. 
- Access to the two powerups you gain for completing ascensions (Speed and Search) can also be given as items.
- (Optional) Every Eggy that can be interacted with can be a check.

In order to goal, you will need to fully complete all ascensions in Eggman Origin.

In all reality, I've always been interested in Sonic Dreams Collection ever since it came out, due to the sheer 
audacity of its' content, as well as how it uses its' premise as a commentary on online fandoms that spiral out of 
control. I only recently decided to bring it to Archipelago however after [Dokibird's playthrough of the game.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1eLbHPxkkk)

Looking back, I find it fascinating that many fandoms have followed in the footsteps of the Sonic fandom in terms 
of their impressionistic insanity. These days, you could easily justify the creation of a "FNaF Dreams Collection", 
"Persona Dreams Collection", or a "South Park Dreams Collection" and they would all work just as well as Sonic 
Dreams Collection does to Sonic fans. Humans are interesting creatures indeed...
