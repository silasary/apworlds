# Peggle Nights

Peggle Nights expands the pachinko-inspired formula with a nocturnal theme, introducing new challenges that take
place within the dreamscapes of the Peggle Masters. Featuring a new Master, Marina, and her electricity-based
power-up, the game offers additional levels and trials that demand refined skill and tactical shot-planning.
