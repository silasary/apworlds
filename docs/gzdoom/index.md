# gzDoom

gzDoom is an open-source enhanced port of the Doom engine, supporting Doom 1/2, Hexen, Heretic, and Strife, along
with thousands of fan-made maps and mission packs and even a few commercial games like Hedon Bloodrite and Selaco.

This randomizer comes with an automated WAD scanner that makes it easy to add support for new WADs.
