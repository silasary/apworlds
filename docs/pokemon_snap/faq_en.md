### Oak won't Rate my Photos / There is a red dot when taking photos / Pikachu is detected as a Pokemon Sign

**Solution: Troubleshoot your base ROM**

This likely isn't related to the AP and is an issue with your emulator vs base Pokemon Snap ROM in general. 
Confirm by attempting to submit photos in your base ROM. The following steps have all been known to help:

 - Ensure you are using Project64 `3.0` NOT `4.0`
 - Swap to a different RDP plugin. Both the [angrylion-plus](https://github.com/ata4/angrylion-rdp-plus/releases) and [Parallel RDP Plugin](https://github.com/ariahiro64/pj64-parallelrdp/releases/tag/1.4) have been reported to work with Parallel having better performance.

### How come I was able to Snap (whatever) out of logic?
