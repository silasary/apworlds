appear. The mod's own runtime log is `~/.local/share/mth-apclient/mthap_*.log` (one file per run).

## Running
An ImGui overlay window should appear allowing connection and disconnection to an AP server. If it
doesn't appear or you want to hide it once connected, it can be toggled by pressing `F2`.

You will see "disconnected" instead of "Start Game" until you are connected to a multiworld.

You will automatically load into a save once you click "Start game"

## Debugging

There is also a console you can access by presssing **F1**. type ```help``` to see commands
