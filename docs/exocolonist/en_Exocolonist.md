I Was a Teenage Exocolonist is a visual novel card battler time loop game about growing up on an alien planet. You have 10 years to survive, hopefully making friendships and lasting memories along the way.

# What's randomized?

## Locations

Every job you can unlock is a location.

### Friendsanity

If enabled, each multiple of 10 friendship points for each character is a check.

### Datesanity

If enabled, dating each character is a check.

### Perksanity

If enabled, each skill perk is a check. Additionally, skills will be locked so you cannot progress past a perk you don't have. As an example, if you have perception perk 1 you can level your perception to 66. But if you have no perks, you can only level the skill to 33.

## Items

You can receive job unlocks and consumables to use in card battles or as gifts for characters. If perksanity is enabled, you will also receive progressive skill perks.

In order to age up you will need to receive a progressive year. For example, if you only have 3 progressive years the game will end (but not goal) when you age up to 14.
