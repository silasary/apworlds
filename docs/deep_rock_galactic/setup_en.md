# Deep Rock Galactic Randomizer Setup Guide

## Required Software

- [Archipelago](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases/latest)
- [The DRG apworld](https://github.com/Cousinit117/Deep-Rock-Galactic-AP/releases), 
  if not bundled with your version of Archipelago
- [The DRG Archipelago Mod](https://mod.io/g/drg/m/test-archipelago-integration#description)

## How to Setup The Server

First, you need a room to connect to. For this, you or someone you know has to generate a game.  
This will not be explained here,
but you can check the [Archipelago Setup Guide](/tutorial/Archipelago/setup_en#generating-a-game).

You also need to have [Archipelago](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases/latest) installed
and the [The DRG apworld](https://github.com/Cousinit117/Deep-Rock-Galactic-AP/releases) installed into Archipelago.

From here, connecting to your DRG slot is only a few more steps.

### Setup Your Client in Archipelago

1) Download the Latest [The DRG apworld](https://github.com/Cousinit117/Deep-Rock-Galactic-AP/releases) and make sure it's installed into your archipelago (Generally by being put into the custom_worlds folder)
2) Launch your archipelago client and open the "DRG Client"
3) Connect to your slot. This is important to do before loading into deep rock galactic for the first time so it can register your settings into the in game mod folder.

### Setup Your Mod in DRG

1) Subscribe to the DRG mod on mod.io: [The DRG Archipelago Mod](https://mod.io/g/drg/m/test-archipelago-integration#description)
2) Load your game and the mod should install (This may prompt you to make a sandbox save, in which case skip to step 4)
3) If you weren't prompted to make a new save; Go to your pause menu -> save options
4) Create a new save that matches your slot name in your multiworld, and load into it.
5) Your DRG game is now setup for Archipelago.

### Connecting To The Host (Webhost - Untested)

If your room is hosted on a WebHost (e.g. [archipelago.gg](https://archipelago.gg)),
you should be able to simply click on your name in the player list.  
This will open the Archipelago Launcher
and ask you whether you want to connect with the Text Client or the DRG Client.

### Connecting To The Host (Locally)

If your room does not have a WebHost room page available, you can launch DRG manually.  

Open the Archipelago Launcher, and then select the DRG Client from the list.  
After a short while, the DRG client should open.  
Enter the server address at the top and click "Connect".  
Then, enter your name. If a password exists, enter the password.  
You should now be connected and able to play Deep Rock Galactic.

## Switching Rooms

To switch rooms or slots with DRG, you must disconnect and reconnect. You will also have to have a seperate in game save for each slot you with to connect to.
