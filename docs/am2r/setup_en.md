## Installation Process

### Installing Multiworld Mod

Download and set up the latest release of [AM2R Launcher](https://github.com/AM2R-Community-Developers/AM2RLauncher/releases) using your copy of AM2R 1.1 then in the launcher you can
under the `Mod Settings` tab, hit the `ADD NEW MOD` button, and select Multiworld mod `.zip` file from either of the Multiworld Mod downloads.

Finally, from the `Play` tab select the `Multiworld` profile and hit `Install` and then play to load up the mod.

## Joining a Multiworld Session

After the host has generated the seed and has given you the connection information you can use the `Archipelago Launcher` 
to run the `AM2R Client` after that run the AM2R Multiworld Mod and go to the settings to find the `Multiworld` menu to enter 
the slot name (player name) and hit `Connect to Python Client` the client will then show `Successfully Connected to AM2R`
at which point you can run /connect [IP]:[PORT] or use the address bar at the top with the same formatting to connect to the
multiworld session at which point you can start a new save file or continue a save file.

## Joining a Multitroid Session

Assuming there is soneone hosting a Multitroid server you can navigate to the `Multitroid` muenu in the AM2R settings
and enter the server address and port into the relevant spots at which point you can also pick a special multitroid color
as well as a team if the server has teams enabled for PVP.

# Things are subject to change at developer discretion

### Seeds should be beatable but its possible there are still logical errors

## Bug Reporting/Feature Requests

If you are playing this mod and are encountering bugs **DO NOT** report them to the Archipelago server this is not 
official support from them, and they may or may not know what to do instead you can report them to the dedicated mod 
thread on the [AM2R Server](https://discord.gg/YTQnkAJ) or on the [Modding Server](https://discord.gg/Fdq3MSXEDb) and you can always open an issue on the GitHub.

### Help I don't have enough energy to do this check with 100% trap fill on fusion mode

Fuck you, if the testers can do it you can too, and if you cant do it play on an easier difficulty.
