# AM2R 

## Where is the options page?
The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a config file.

## How do I set up a multiworld game?
The setup guide can be found [here](../../../tutorial/AM2R/setup_en).
## What does randomizer do to this game?
You will be playing on a slightly modified version of the New Game Plus map.  

Notable changes to the map include:
- Helper septoggs are conditionally placed in certain spots in the main caves area to help with vertical navigation
- The entire world is open from the start, except for the laboratory so you can go fight omega metroids right away
- The bomb blocks that block the way down to Hydro Station are removed

The randomizer will randomize all items aside from Power Grip Morph Ball and the initial 30 missiles.

## What do remote items look like?

Items that are not from AM2R will appear as one of 2 sprites depending on if they are a progression item or not
- progression items will appear as colorful AP orbs in a capsule
- non-progression items will appear as a blue-gray orbs without a capsule
Any item (not just remote items) with the trap flag enabled will appear as a random sprite from a wide pool depending on the yaml option you pick

## Thursday?

The AM2R community has an onging joke that AM2R 2.0 will release on Thursday, so there are several Thursday related jokes because of this.
