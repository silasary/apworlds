# Required Software

- Simpsons Hit And Run - Created and tested on the English release but *should* work on other versions.
- [Lucas' Mod Manager](https://modbakery.donutteam.com/releases/view/6)
- [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg/)
- The latest release of the [client/memory manager and the lmlm mod](https://github.com/nmize1/AP-SHARRandomizer/releases/latest)
- The latest release of the [apworld](https://github.com/nmize1/Archipelago/releases/latest).
- [.NET 8 (x86)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) (**NOT x64**)

# Install Lucas' Mod Manager, the lmlm mod, and the client/memory monitor mod.

- Follow [these](https://docs.donutteam.com/docs/lucasmodlauncher/setup) instructions to setup Lucas' Mod Manager.
- Place SHARAP.lmlm in the mods folder.
- Enable SHARAP.lmlm by clicking the checkbox on the Mods List. Currently, no other major mods are supported.
- Check [here](https://docs.donutteam.com/docs/lucasmodlauncher/mods/installing-mods) for more help installing mods.
- Under the "Settings" tab of the mod launcher, there are several optional but recommended mods. Read through the list and enable anything you think you'd like. I **highly** suggest No Automatic Saved Game Load. This will prevent accidentally sending checks on the main menu from old saved games. Free Roam, Never Busted, No Jump Limit, No Time Limits, No Traffic, No Wrenches, One Tap Player Car Death, Repair Car on Reset, and Starting Coins are all incompatible or highly discouraged. They will break the intended experience even if they do work.
- Install .NET 8 from the link above. Make sure to install the **x86** version. The site will default to x64 as that's more modern, but SHAR needs x86.
- Finally, extract SHARRandomizer.zip where ever you'd like.

# Connecting and Playing

- Run SHARRandomizer.exe in the extracted SHARRandomizer folder. In the command prompt that opens, input your connection info. You *can* use this window as a client, but its currently missing several features of the standard client and will be filled with several dev messages so I **highly** suggest using the standard text client also. This is required if you want to hint because the game client doesn't currently support input after connection.

- Launch the game via Lucas' Mod Launcher ensuring the above steps have been completed.

- Enjoy!
