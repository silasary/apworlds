# Freedom Planet 2

## What does randomization do to this game?

The randomiser shuffles Star Cards, Time Capsules, Stage Unlocks and Brave Stones into the Archipelago item pool. The Classic Mode world map is used for stage selecting, as well as accessing the two shops if applicable.

## What is the goal of a Manual game when randomized?
The goal is to acquire enough Star Cards and Time Capsules (and the appropriate chapter unlock if applicable) to unlock and complete Weapon's Core.

## What does another world's item look like in Freedom Planet 2

By default, items will appear as an Archipelago logo (a normal one for standard items, one with an upwards pointing arrow on it for progression items and one with the layering inverted for traps.) Custom sprites can be defined, as described [here](https://github.com/Knuxfan24/Freedom-Planet-2-Archipelago/wiki/Custom#item-sprites-and-descriptions).
