# Against The Storm

## What does randomization do to this game?
All resources are blocked from being acquired until their Item is received from Archipelago.
If blueprints are shuffled, the standard means of acquiring them by reputation draft rewards will be disabled.
Optionally, all production recipes can be shuffled.

## What Against The Storm items are randomized?
"Items" in this case are the ability to acquire the blocked resources. 
The exceptions to this are you can always gather Wood and Water, and you will always receive resources from embarkation and deconstruction.
In addition, blueprints can be shuffled as well, and will be added as essential bluperints for every settlement once received from the multiworld.

## Known Issues as of v1.0.0
* The trade related locations, because they are handled by trade routes, proc trade route related in game effects.
* With `blueprint_items` on, the reputation blueprint reward button doesn't correctly disable if you connect during a run. When your reward changes, it should correct itself.
