## Game Setup Instructions
No game modding is required to play Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 with the Archipelago. The client included with the APWorld does all the work by attaching to the game process and monitoring and manipulating the game state in real-time.

**Note:** You will need to have at least 8 (and ideally every) level unlocked through vanilla play before playing the Archipelago implementation. The mod cannot unlock them on your behalf.
