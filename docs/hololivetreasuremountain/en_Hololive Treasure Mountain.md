# Hololive Treasure Mountain

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a config file.

## What does randomisation do to this game?

Randomisation locks treasures behind items in the multiworld.
Completing the requirements to unlock a treasure normally will send a multiworld item to yourself or another player.

## What is the goal of Hololive Treasure Mountain when randomised?

The goal is configurable on the options page.
It consists of one or more of:

- Unlock some specific or some number of treasures
- Create some specific or some number of treasures at the largest size
- Reach some specific or some number of locations (checks)
- Merge pairs of some specific or some number of treasures at the largest size, causing them to disappear

## What does another world's item look like in Hololive Treasure Mountain?

In the “Treasure Index”, an Archipelago icon will appear in the corner of each treasure with an associated location.
Depending on your visibility settings, it may have an outline to indicate its item class.
If the location has been reached, a check mark will appear on top of the icon.
If the icon is black, then the item has been collected, and reaching the location will not award anything, but may still be required by your goal condition.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

It will be displayed the next time the player finishes a round or views the title menu.

## What counts as a death for the purpose of Death Link?

Dropping a treasure in the water will send a Death Link.

## What happens when a Death Link is received?

If the player is currently in game, their treasures will fall in the water.

If they are not in game, the Death Link will be ignored.
