# UFO 50 Setup Guide

## Required Software
- [UFO 50](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1147860/UFO_50/) for PC
- The [UFO 50 APWorld](https://github.com/UFO-50-Archipelago/Archipelago/releases)

## Installation

### Automated Installation
1. Place the UFO 50 APWorld in your `custom_worlds` folder.
2. Create a new folder for the modded UFO 50 installation (don't put it in your normal UFO 50 install folder). Do not manually copy anything into this folder.
3. Open the Archipelago Launcher and click on the UFO 50 Client.
4. When it asks you to select a folder for the mod installation, select the folder you created in step 2.
5. When it asks you to locate the UFO 50 executable, navigate to your UFO 50 .exe file and select it.
6. To launch the game, run the UFO 50 Client from the Archipelago Launcher.


### Manual Installation

Do not follow these steps if you are doing the Automated Installation above.

Extra required software:
- A way to apply `.bsdiff4` patches, such as [bspatch](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/929/).

Steps:
1. Copy all of your UFO 50 files to a safe location.
2. Extract all files from `ufo_50_archipelago.zip` into the same directory as the files extracted in the previous step.
   * This should include, at least, `ufo_50_basepatch.bsdiff4` and `gm-apclientpp.dll`.
3. Delete `steam_api64.dll` and `Steamworks_x64.dll`.
4. If you don't have `original_data.win`, copy `data.win` and rename its copy to `original_data.win`.
   * By keeping an unmodified copy of `data.win`, you will have an easier time updating in the future.
5. Apply the `ufo_50_basepatch.bsdiff4` patch using your patching software.
6. To launch the game, run `ufo50.exe`.

### Downpatching UFO 50

As UFO 50 is a game that is still receiving updates, periods of time between new official patches and the mod being updated will exist.
Therefore, the user may end up having to either wait for the mod to be updated or use an older version of the game in order to play. You can check which version of UFO 50 the mod targets [in the patch releases page](https://github.com/UFO-50-Archipelago/Patch/releases).
