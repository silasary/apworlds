# Factorio Randomizer Setup Guide

❗This guide is similar to the regular Factorio implementation, but the initial server setup is a bit different.  Sections that have been changed are highlighted.

## Required Software

##### Players

- Factorio: [Factorio Official Website](https://factorio.com)
    - Needed by Players and Hosts

##### Server Hosts

- Factorio: [Factorio Official Website](https://factorio.com)
    - Needed by Players and Hosts
- Archipelago: [Archipelago Releases Page](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases)
    - Needed by Hosts

## Create a Config (.yaml) File

### What is a config file and why do I need one?

Your config file contains a set of configuration options which provide the generator with information about how it
should generate your game. Each player of a multiworld will provide their own config file. This setup allows each player
to enjoy an experience customized for their taste, and different players in the same multiworld can all have different
options.

### Where do I get a config file?

The Player Options page on the website allows you to configure your personal options and export a config file from
them. Factorio player options page: [Factorio Options Page](/games/Factorio/player-options)

### Verifying your config file

If you would like to validate your config file to make sure it works, you may do so on the YAML Validator page. YAML
Validator page: [Yaml Validation Page](/check)

## Connecting to Someone Else's Factorio Game

Connecting to someone else's game is the simplest way to play Factorio with Archipelago. It allows multiple people to
play in a single world, all contributing to the completion of the seed.

1. Acquire the Archipelago mod for this seed. It should be named `AP_*.zip`, where `*` is the seed number.
2. Copy the mod file into your Factorio `mods` folder, which by default is located at:
   `C:\Users\<YourUserName>\AppData\Roaming\Factorio\mods`
3. Get the server address from the person hosting the game you are joining.
4. Launch Factorio
5. Click on "Multiplayer" in the main menu
6. Click on "Connect to address"
7. Enter the address into this box
8. Click "Connect"

## Prepare to Host Your Own Factorio Game

### Defining Some Terms

In Archipelago, multiple Factorio worlds may be played simultaneously. Each of these worlds must be hosted by a Factorio
server, which is connected to the Archipelago Server via middleware.

This guide uses the following terms to refer to the software:

- **Factorio Client** - The Factorio instance which will be used to play the game.
- **Factorio Server** - The Factorio instance which will be used to host the Factorio world. Any number of Factorio
  Clients may connect to this server.
- **Archipelago Client** - The middleware software used to connect the Factorio Server to the Archipelago Server.
- **Archipelago Server** - The central Archipelago server, which connects all games to each other.

### What a Playable State Looks Like

- An Archipelago Server
- The generated Factorio Mod, created as a result of running `ArchipelagoGenerate.exe`
- One running instance of `ArchipelagoFactorioClient.exe` (the Archipelago Client) per Factorio world
- A running modded Factorio Server, which should have been started by the Archipelago Client automatically
- A running modded Factorio Client

#### Configure your Archipelago Installation

:exclamation: This is different from regular AP Factorio

Unlike the default Factorio setup, SAWS expects you to use your normal Factorio install for both Client and Server.

```yaml
factorio_saws_options:
  executable: "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Factorio\\bin\\x64\\factorio.exe"
```

This allows you to host your own Factorio game.

## Hosting Your Own Factorio Game

:exclamation: This is different from regular AP Factorio

1. Obtain the Factorio mod for this Archipelago seed. It should be named `AP_*.zip`, where `*` is the seed number.
2. Install the mod into your Factorio Server by copying the zip file into the `Archipelago/factorio_saws/mods` folder. If this folder does not exist, launch the SAWS client once to generate the server files.
   * :exclamation: This is not the server's default mod directory.  This is a APSAWS-specific folder in your Archipelago directory.
4. Download the latest version of https://mods.factorio.com/mod/SpaceAgeWithoutSpace and place it in the same folder.
5. Install the mod into your Factorio Client by copying the zip file into the `mods` folder, which is likely located
   at `C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Roaming\Factorio\mods`.
6. Obtain the Archipelago Server address from the website's host room, or from the server host.
7. Run your Archipelago Launcher, and select the "Factorio: Space Age Without Space Client"
8. Enter `/connect [server-address]` into the input box at the bottom of the Archipelago Client and press "Enter"

![Factorio Client for Archipelago Connection Command](/static/generated/docs/Factorio/connect-to-ap-server.png)

8. Launch your Factorio Client
9. Click on "Multiplayer" in the main menu
10. Click on "Connect to address"
11. Enter `localhost` into the server address box
12. Click "Connect"

For additional client features, issue the `/help` command in the Archipelago Client. Once connected to the AP server,
you can also issue the `!help` command to learn about additional commands like `!hint`.
For more information about the commands you can use, see the [Commands Guide](/tutorial/Archipelago/commands/en) and
[Other Options](#other-options).

## Allowing Other People to Join Your Game

1. Ensure your Archipelago Client is running.
2. Ensure port `34197` is forwarded to the computer running the Archipelago Client.
3. Obtain your IP address by visiting whatismyip.com: [WhatIsMyIP Website](https://whatismyip.com/).
4. Provide your IP address to anyone you want to join your game, and have them follow the steps for
   "Connecting to Someone Else's Factorio Game" above.

## Enabling Peaceful Mode

By default, peaceful mode is disabled. There are two methods to enable peaceful mode:

### By config file
You can specify Factorio game options such as peaceful mode and terrain and resource generation parameters in your
config .yaml file by including the `world_gen` option. This option is currently not supported by the web UI, so you'll
have to manually create or edit your config file with a text editor of your choice.
The [template file](/static/generated/configs/Factorio.yaml) is a good starting point and contains the default value of
the `world_gen` option. If you already have a config file you may also just copy that option over from the template.
To enable peaceful mode, simply replace `peaceful_mode: false` with `peaceful_mode: true`. Finally, use the
[.yaml checker](/check) to ensure your file is valid.

### After starting
If you have already submitted your config file, generated the seed, or even started playing, you can retroactively
enable peaceful mode by entering the following commands into your Archipelago Factorio Client:
```
/factorio /c game.surfaces[1].peaceful_mode=true
/factorio /c game.forces["enemy"].kill_all_units()
```
(If this warns you that these commands may disable achievements, you may need to repeat them for them to take effect.)

## Other Options

### filter_item_sends

By default, all item sends are displayed in-game. In larger async seeds this may become overly spammy.
To hide all item sends that are not to or from your factory, do one of the following:
- Type `/toggle-ap-send-filter` in-game
- Type `/toggle_send_filter` in the Archipelago Client
- In your `host.yaml` set
```
factorio_options:
  filter_item_sends: true
```

### bridge_chat_out
By default, in-game chat is bridged to Archipelago. If you prefer to be able to speak privately, you can disable this
feature by doing one of the following:
- Type `/toggle-ap-chat` in-game
- Type `/toggle_chat` in the Archipelago Client
- In your `host.yaml` set
```
factorio_options:
  bridge_chat_out: false
```
Note that this will also disable `!` commands from within the game, and that it will not affect incoming chat.

## Troubleshooting

In case any problems should occur, the Archipelago Client will create a file `FactorioClient.txt` in the `/logs`. The
contents of this file may help you troubleshoot an issue on your own and is vital for requesting help from other people
in Archipelago.

###     • Missing required dependency SpaceAgeWithoutSpace >= 0.0.10

Make sure you have downloaded [SpaceAgeWithoutSpace](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/SpaceAgeWithoutSpace/downloads) into your `factorio_saws` mods folder.
