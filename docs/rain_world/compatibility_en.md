# Rain World mod compatibility

The majority of Remix mods will work with the Randomizer mod and Archipelago,
but there are a few exceptions and caveats.
Generally, mods that may be problems are:
- those which move objects or events around, even if not randomly.
  - This includes some custom slugcat mods, which may have their own alternate settings files for regions and rooms.
- those which change existing connections between rooms or regions.

Compatibility may change over time.
Incompatible mods may be supported in future versions.
Mods not listed here are probably compatible.
