# Rain World

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options)
contains all the options you need to configure and export a config file.

## What is the win condition?

The default goal is ascension.
Logically, this requires raising max karma to 10 and gain access to Subterranean.
The win condition is met upon entering the Void Sea itself.
If More Slugcats Expansion is enabled,
the option for alternate victory conditions is available for most Slugcats.

## What does randomization do to Rain World?

### Karma and Echoes
Initial max karma is 1 by default, regardless of Slugcat.
Raising max karma requires finding karma cap increases in the item pool rather than meeting echoes.
Meeting echoes still requires either a certain karma level depending on current max
or karma flower reinforcement (except for Saint, who can always see echoes).
There are at least 8 karma cap increases
(one increase is worth 2 as max karma jumps from 5 to 7),
though more may be added through the settings.

### Gates
By default, karma gates require unique keys which are added to the pool instead of karma.
Currently collected keys are displayed on the pause screen in-game.
If gates are set to potentially use karma in the settings, they have Monk campaign behavior
(they only need karma the first time they are used).

### Passages
Completing a passage is a check.
Passage tokens are added to the item pool, rather than being awarded by completing passages.
Hunter and Saint can use passage tokens to fast travel.

### The Mark of Communication
The Mark of Communication is added to the item pool.
Five Pebbles does not automatically give the Mark to Monk, Survivor, Gourmand, or Artificer,
and Looks to the Moon does not automatically give Spearmaster the Mark.
Hunter and Rivulet do not start with the Mark.
The Mark is still required to make progress on The Scholar,
and certain alternate victory conditions require the Mark.

### Neuron Glow
Neuron glow is added to the item pool.
Eating a neuron fly does not automatically grant the glow.
By default, Shaded Citadel, Filtration System, and parts of lower Pipeyard logically require the glow.

### Story flags
Story flags are added to the item pool:
- Hunter does not start with the green neuron.
- Artificer does not start with the citizen ID drone.
- The rarefaction cell is not found in the heart of The Rot.
- Rivulet's increased cycle duration is an item in the pool.
- Spearmaster does not receive their pearl by meeting Five Pebbles.
- Spearmaster's pearl does not get rewritten by meeting Looks to the Moon with the pearl.

### Remix settings
Certain Rain World Remix settings are overridden while the Randomizer mod is active:
- Passage progress without Survivor (see [the checks subpage](/tutorial/Rain%20World/checks/en))
- Monk-style gates for all campaigns (see [the settings subpage](/tutorial/Rain%20World/settings/en))

## Is the Archipelago mod compatible with other mods or DLC?

More Slugcats Expansion (Downpour) is fully supported.
Other mods are not directly supported, but most mods are still compatible with Archipelago.
See [the compatibility subpage](/tutorial/Rain%20World/compatibility/en) for more details.

## What counts as a check?

Collecting Arena/Safari tokens, bringing unique colored pearls to a shelter,
meeting echoes, completing passages, completing parts of the food quest (if More Slugcats Expansion is enabled)
and several other unique actions (such as meeting Five Pebbles) all count as checks.
See [the checks subpage](/tutorial/Rain%20World/checks/en) for more details.

## What items are added to the pool?

Karma cap increases, gate keys, the Mark of Communication, the neuron glow, passage tokens and
various story items (such as Hunter's green Neuron, Rivulet's rarefaction cell, and Spearmaster's pearl)
are added as primary progression items.
Filler items come in the form of various foods, weapons, and traps.
See [the items subpage](/tutorial/Rain%20World/items/en) for more details.

## Where should I report problems?

The Archipelago Discord has a `Rain World` thread in the `future-game-design` forum where problems may be reported.
Alternatively, you can create an issue
on the [APWorld GitHub](https://github.com/alphappy/ArchipelagoRW/issues)
if it's an issue with the generation, player YAML settings, or the logic,
or on the [Randomizer GitHub](https://github.com/SaltiestSyrup/RWRandomizer/issues)
if it's an issue with the mod.
