# The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks


## What does randomisation do to this game?

Anything that would give an item to the player in vanilla now sends a location to the multiworld. Some cutscenes have been removed for a good randomiser experience.

## What is the goal of Spirit Tracks when randomised?

As chosen in the yaml file, the goal is either doing a certain location check in game or beating the final boss.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

Every item in the game gets shuffled as long as it is required in logic. Anything that would give an item to the player in vanilla is now a location

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any shuffled item can be in other players' worlds.

## What does another world's item look like in Spirit Tracks

Currently, items look like their vanilla sprites in Spirit Tracks.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

The item is added to whichever menu is applicable, i.e item menu, collection screen etc
