## FAQ
### I can't leave Outset/Aboda
You need to get two locations, `Outset Clear Rocks` and `Outset Bee Item` and reload the room before Zelda will spawn to let you on the train, and you need the `Forest Glyph` and `Cannon` to use the train.

### My train is slow
You can adjust the train speed with `/train` in your bizhawk client

### Is there a map tracker?
Yes! Get [Universal Tracker](https://github.com/FarisTheAncient/Archipelago/releases) and it will create a simple map page!
