# The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks AP Setup Guide

## Required Software

* [Archipelago 0.6.1+](https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en)
* [Bizhawk 2.10+](https://github.com/TASEmulators/BizHawk)
* Legally acquired Spirit Tracks EU rom *(Not revision 1)*. Apparently it only works in English
* [Latest tloz_st.apworld](https://github.com/DayKat/spirit-tracks/releases)

## Recommended Software

* [Universal Tracker](https://github.com/FarisTheAncient/Archipelago/releases)

## Setup

1. Find your Archipelago directory, and put tloz_st.apworld in the 'custom_worlds' folder
2. Create a yaml settings file, and put it in the Archipelago directories 'players' folder. You can generate a template yaml with the archipelago launcher.
3. Generate your game
4. Host the game, either locally or via the archipelago web hosting service
5. Open the 'generic bizhawk client' in Archipelago, and connect to the server
6. Launch the vanilla game in bizhawk, and open the lua console. Add the 'connector_bizhawk_generic.lua' script that can be found in 'Archipelago\data\lua'. 
7. You are now ready to play! Start a new savefile and go!

## Important:

- When starting a new savefile, connect the lua to the client before starting. Using an in-progress file should be fine in either order.
- On a new seed, DO NOT TALK TO ALFONSO to start the tutorial until zelda appears at the station. She'll appear after doing the "Outset Clear Rocks" and "Outset Bee Tree" checks, and if you have received both Forest Glyph and Cannon.
- If you feel you are stuck when you should be able to do something and the game is not allowing it, going in and out of a loading zone (e.g a house) might fix it so try that first.
