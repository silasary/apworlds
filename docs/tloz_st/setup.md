## Setup

1. Find your Archipelago directory, and put tloz_st.apworld in the 'custom_worlds' folder

4. Host the game, either locally or via the archipelago web hosting service
5. Open the 'generic bizhawk client' in Archipelago, and connect to the server
6. Launch the vanilla game in bizhawk, and open the lua console. Add the 'connector_bizhawk_generic.lua' script that can be found in 'Archipelago\data\lua'. 
7. You are now ready to play! Start a new savefile and go!

## FAQ/Useful Info
### My train is slow
You can adjust the train speed and other settings with `/train` in your bizhawk client

### Is there a map tracker?
Yes! Get [Universal Tracker](https://github.com/FarisTheAncient/Archipelago/releases) and it will create a simple map page!

### Can I warp to start?
You can warp to start with the client command `/warp_to_start` and entering an entrance or saving and quitting. 
This also refills your ammo.

### What is my current goal?
You can check your current goal and progress towards it at any time with the client command `/goal`

### What is different from vanilla or has unintuitive requirements in vanilla?
- If playing with randomized passengers, NPCs let you pick them up for quests once you have the rail holding their destination station. Exception being Alfonzo, who spawns in Hyrule Castle with the Snow Glyph.
- Some minigames open with vanilla requirements. Hyrule sword game opens with Snow Source, Goron target range opens after removing the first lava in Goron village and each level of Take ‘em all on unlocks with forest-ocean-sand sources. Unlocking a higher level also unlocks the lower ones. 
- Beedle spawns with Snow Source
- When playing with combined track items, anything unlocked by a source is unlocked by packs containing that source track.
- The arena at the top of desert temple 1f has two states, each with 2 locations. In vanilla it switches state after getting the sand rod chest. In rando it switches after getting both checks in the first state and reloading the room.
- Ferrus has slightly different behavior in different passenger rando settings. You can pick him up south of Blizzard Temple if you’ve already picked up Alfonzo or have the Alfonzo item, and you can pick him up in Fire Realm if you have access to the Marine Temple. If vanilla passengers, he will give you his final item south of Wooded Temple after taking him to Marine Temple, while if vanilla abstract or randomized that location unlocks after getting the Ferrus item.
- Certain intro locations are missing. These include the vanilla locations of Engineer Certificate, Hero’s Outfit, Sword and Cannon.
- The Tower of Spirits summit counts as its own section for tower shuffle, and the stamp stand location there can’t be excluded or removed along with other sections. 
- The blue warp through ToS 5 will always be open if ToS 5 is excluded, meaning you still need to fight Staven to check what’s on the other side.
- Progressive tears of light with tower shuffle use the vanilla entrances to determine the order. So the order is entrance 1, e2 (forest source), e3 (snow source), e4 (ocean source), e5 (fire source), exit staven, enter altar in summit. Even if the summit is randomized to be your first section, the progressive tears for the section within will be last in the order.
