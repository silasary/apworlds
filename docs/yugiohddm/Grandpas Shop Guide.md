## The Missing Dice
The one die that cannot be bought from Grandpa's Shop is D. Magician Girl.
You can still obtain this die as a random reward when your bonus item mode is set to Dice instead of Shop. She can also be obtained as a drop from beating Yami Yugi.
If you set your starting dice pool to random she has the same chance as all other dice to be in it.
