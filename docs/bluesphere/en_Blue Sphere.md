## Hint games

Blue Sphere is a **hint game**. It can connect to any slot in your multiworld and unlock random location hints,
revealing what items were placed into that world.

This means that it doesn't create a slot, and doesn't have any configurable options. You do *not* need to include Blue Sphere
when generating your multiworld.
