# Armored Core

## What does randomization do to this game?

Mission order, acquiring Parts, starting AC, and receiving bonus Human+ levels and Credits are all randomized.

## What is the goal of Armored Core when randomized?

In Progressive Missions mode, complete Destroy Floating Mines.
In Mission-Sanity mode, complete a number of missions you can set between 1 and 46.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

Each mission completed is a location where you can find a check.
Each piece of Mail read is a location.
With Shopsanity on, each part listing can be purchased for items separate from the ones you already own.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Missions and Progressive Missions depending on how you are playing, as well as filler (Credits, Human+ Levels, Parts, etc).

## What does another world's item look like in Armored Core?

Your item acquisitions take the form of having completed a mission, reading mail, or buying a Part from the shop.
You'll have to check the BizHawk client to know the actual items that are unlocked from non-shop locations.
Note that mission completion isn't checked until you have re-entered the Raven's Nest menu.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

In the Raven's Nest menu the client will update the Mission list with what you have access to. If you are currently in the Mission list when sent a mission, you have to exit and re-enter for it to update.
Parts can be equipped in the Garage when sent to you. If you are already in the Garage you will have to exit and re-enter.
