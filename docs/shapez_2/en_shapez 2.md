# shapez 2

## What is this game?

shapez 2 is an automation game about cutting, rotating, stacking, and painting shapes, that you extract from
randomly generated islands in an infinite space, without having to pay for building your factories.
It is the successor to shapez and contains a variety of more features like crystals, space platforms and belts,
trains, and an astounding new 3-dimensional gameplay environment in space.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Buildings and gameplay mechanics, that you normally unlock by completing a milestone or buying an upgrade, are put 
into the item pool of the multiworld. Also, the shape requirements milestones, tasks, and operator lines are randomized.

## What is the goal of shapez 2 in Archipelago?

As the game has no actual goal where the gameplay ends, there are (currently) 2 different goals you can choose from in 
the player options:
1. Milestones: Complete all milestones.
2. Operator levels: Check all operator level checks.
The amounts of milestones and operator level checks in your world can be adjusted in the player options.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

- Building unlocks
- Space platform unlocks
- Various mechanics (e.g. blueprints, additional floors, ...)
- Task line unlocks
- Operator line unlocks
- Platform points
- Research points
- Bluprint points

## What is considered a location check?

- Milestones (3-20 milestones with 2-12 checks per milestone)
- Tasks (3-200 task lines with 1-5 checks per task line)
- Operator levels (0-200)

## FAQ (kinda)

- ***How do I set up this game?***
  <br>If you're new to setting up a custom apworld, type `&apworld` into the `#aginahbot-spam` channel on the 
      Discord server for more information.
  <br>Other than that, follow the [setup guide for this game.](setup_en.md)
- ***Where is the options page?***
  <br>As this game is not (yet) merged into main, type `&template` into the `#aginahbot-spam` channel on the 
      Discord server for more information.
- ***What about feature XY?***
  <br>This apworld uses custom scenarios, which are a feature already built into the vanilla game, and can thereby be 
      played with a mod. However, they are quite limited in how they can change the vanilla gameplay, so pretty much 
      everything that's not already implemented would inevitably require to use a mod.
  <br>If you're reading this before the 1.0 update for shapez 2 is released, then you can literally not use the mod, 
      which means that more features are just not possible at the moment. I'm also not planning on adding more features 
      even when version 1.0 releases (except for adding the new upcoming game mode later down the road).
- ***How can I even play this if there is no mod?***
  <br>If you play this in a singleplayer multiworld (i.e. there is only one player), then after setting it up, it will 
      just work (without connecting to a server). If not, then you can play it in a manual-like way where you send 
      location checks using a client window and receive items by enabling them in the debug console. More details 
      can be found in the [setup page](setup_en.md).
- ***Is there a tracker?***
  <br>You can use the Universal Tracker, which is fully compatible with this game. See the 
      `#universal-tracker` channel on the Discord server for more information.
- ***An option told me to see the option guides.***
  <br>The option guides can be found [here](option_guides.md).
- ***I want to contribute to development, how can I do that?***
  <br>First of all, propose your ideas/changes/... in the game's channel, so we can talk about things beforehand.
  <br>The fork of this implementation is found at https://github.com/BlastSlimey/Archipelago/tree/shapez_2.
- ***This game info page looks quite different compared to those of other games...***
  <br>This game has not been merged into main yet, and people tend to get confused by "not working" option
      pages (which will only work once merged into main).
  <br>Once this game does get merged into main, this info page and the setup page will be changed 
      to the default structure.
