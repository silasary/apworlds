# Shining in the Darkness

## What does randomization do to this game?

All items that can be obtained from chests are randomized. Some NPC gifts are randomized also:

- The Minister's reward for forming a party after getting the ROYAL TIARA.
- The King's reward for rescuing Princess Jessa.

## What is considered a location check in this game?

All chest locations and NPC gifts already mentioned are location checks. There are plans to add other quest flags (returning Gila to the tavern, defeating Tortolyde, etc.) to the list at some point.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any of the items which can be shuffled may also be placed into another player's world. It is possible to choose to limit
certain items to your own world.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

Nothing happens in-game right now. Keep an eye on the client window!
