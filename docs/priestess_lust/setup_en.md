# Priestess Lust Randomizer Setup Guide

## Required Software

- [Archipelago](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases/latest)
- [The Priestess Lust APworld](https://github.com/NewSoupVi/Archipelago/releases)
- A client mod for Priestess Lust(TBD)

## How to play

First, you need a room to connect to. For this, you or someone you know has to generate a game.  
This will not be explained here,
but you can check the [Archipelago Setup Guide](/tutorial/Archipelago/setup_en#generating-a-game).

You also need to have [Archipelago](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases/latest) installed
and the [The Priestess Lust APWorld](https://github.com/SeesawEffectt/ArchipelagoEffect/releases) installed into Archipelago.
Then, you'll need a client sided mod to handle the rest once somebody more knowledgeable than me picks up this project!
