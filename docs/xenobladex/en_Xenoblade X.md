## What does randomization do to this game?

1. You can get items by: 
    - Completing Map Segments
        - Missions
        - Treasure
        - FN-Sites
        - Tyrants
        - Affinity Missions
    - Fully researching Monster (By killing them 1-3 times according to your `Enemy Index`)
    - Visiting Locations
    - Completing `Collectopedia`
2. You receive the following items:
    - Classes, Arts, Skills
    - Dataprobes
    - Field Skill Levels
    - Skell Armor, Weapons, Augments, Frames
    - Armor, Weapons, Augments
    - Friendship Levels
    - Overdrive, FrontierNav, BladeLicense, Skell License, Flight Module
3. The following changes have been made:
    - Mission Rewards, Treasures, Enemies no longer drop items
    - Field Skills, Arts, Overdrive, FrontierNav, BladeLicense, Skell License, Flight Module
      are no longer obtainable through the story and missions
    - Class and Friendship experience can no longer be obtained
    - Skells are now delivered without any armor or weapons
    - Shop Terminal is disabled
    - Arms Manufacturer Terminal is disabled except for `Upgrade Battle Traits`
    - L's Shop has been relocated to the Blade Scout Terminal
    - For equipment these changes are not effective if disabled in the options
4. Whenever you get equipment via Archipelago the traits will be seeded according to the possible
   traits from within the game. This means that you can only get the traits, that specific piece would 
   have if it were dropped from the usual place inside the game. However every item drop has a 
   unique chance at a higher rarity depending on the enemy it dropped from. Therefore it's fixed at the maximum chance of 5%.

Archipelago only updates when overworld time is progressing.

## What is the goal of Xenoblade X when randomized?
Finish the story and defeat the final boss.

## What do items look like in Xenoblade X?
You can't see the items you get yet, but you will be notified through ingame text messages whenever
you found or received a item.

## Whats next?
- Add Shop items to the available locations.
- Add Schematics/Blueprints to the item pool.
- Add Basic Quests to the available locations.

## Known Issues
- The first time you talk with the new L'shop you will still get denied by the `Only available online` prompt.
- `Important Items` have no logic yet.
- The `AS0115 Formula XT` can somehow not be configured in the garage.
