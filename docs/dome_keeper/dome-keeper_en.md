## Configuring your YAML file

### What is a YAML file and why do I need one?

Your YAML file contains a set of configuration options which provide the generator with information about how it should
generate your game. Each player of a multiworld will provide their own YAML file. This setup allows each player to enjoy
an experience customized for their taste, and different players in the same multiworld can all have different options.

### Where do I get a YAML file?

you can customize your settings by visiting
the [Dome Keeper Settings Page](/games/Dome%20Keeper/player-options).
[test](../player-options)

### Connect to the MultiServer

Once you are in-game, you will be able to click the **Archipelago** menu category in the options menu and enter the ip and port (separated by
a colon) in the hostname field and your slot + password fields. Then click connect, and now you are ready to defend your dome!
