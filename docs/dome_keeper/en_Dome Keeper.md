# Dome Keeper (PC-Steam)

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

In RHs (Relic Hunts), every upgrades in your keeper, dome and primary gadget tree are locked and shuffled.
An additionnal tech tree is in game to unlock items, including new stuff in the mine to unlock items.

For GHs (Guild Assignments), you can't access one assignment until you got the item to unlock it.

## What should I be playing ?

If you're looking for short games, or sync games, I recommend using the Relic Hunt progression type.

If you're looking for async/long games, I recommend using the Guild Assignment one.

## How do I win ?

In RHs, the aim is to win like a normal Relic Hunt.

For GAs, you have to complete all assignments in the difficulty (regular/challenge) chosen.
Oh and of course, if you complete an assignment in challenge mode while you only need regular mode, it checks it nonetheless.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

For syncs:
 - Locations are Archipelago upgrades, switches and a new cave
 - Items are an upgrade unlock, extra cobalt or a layer unlock

For asyncs:
 - Locations are GAs completion (regular and challenge)
 - Items are GAs unlocks, and extra ressources (iron/water/cobalt) to complete them

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any of the items which can be shuffled may also be placed into another player's world.

Every upgrades are considered as "useful" and extra cobalt as "filler", for items dispatching.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

When the player receives an item, you'll see the unlock displayed on the top left of your screen.

If you are viewing the tech tree while you obtain an unlock, it should be unlocked live on the tech tree window.

## What happens if a player dies in a run and I have Death Link active?

When a player dies, your dome will instantly break just like if you actually lost your game (unless you have the relic).

You can freely restart a game, and you'll be able to restart a game with all unlocks you previously had.
