# Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and
export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Items which the player would normally acquire throughout the game have been moved around. Logic remains, so the game is
always able to be completed, but because of the item shuffle, the player may need to access certain areas before they
would in the vanilla game.

The game has been changed to an open-world style as opposed to the linear style the vanilla game has.

Other Features such as Turbo through textboxes (Hold B) and Warping to Rogueport from anywhere (a new Key Item called the Return Pipe you'll start with) have been added for convenience.

## What is the goal of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door when randomized?

Defeat the Shadow Queen in the Palace of Shadow. This requires you to beat a certain number of chapters as well as clear through the palace of shadow.

## What items and locations can get shuffled?

- All Item Blocks and Coin Blocks

## What does another world's item look like in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door?
