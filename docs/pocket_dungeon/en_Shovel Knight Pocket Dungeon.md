# Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon

## What does randomization do to this game?
All of the following items found in the vanilla game can be randomized into the multiworld:
- Key Fragments
- Characters and their refract variants
- Relics
- Hats
- Gems
- Garbage

There are also the following new items:
- Shop Restock
- Progressive Dungeon
- Starting Relic Slot

Progression is balanced by the amount of relics you have acquired, the more relics you get the further the randomizer logic thinks you will be able to do your runs. This doesn't put a hard limit on your progression in-game, you will be able to progress as far as you're able to, even getting to locations that may be considered "out of logic".
You can choose to limit progression through the game by enabling Progressive dungeons, this will mean that after each boss fight you will be blocked from progressing further into your run until you obtain a new Progressive Dungeon item.

## What are locations in this game?
The main bulk of locations are made up out of shops, Chesters Shop inside of the main hub will contain 5 purchasable Archipelago items. Each time a Shop Restock item is obtained 5 new items will be purchasable, however you will need to buy the item from the previous stock first to access it.
Items can also be found in the adventure mode shops, each playable character will have one unique location for each shop. You will have to do runs as each character to see what items can be found in their shops! Note that the refract characters share the same location with their base counterparts.
Additionally, defeating bosses, visiting the 4 shrines and finishing a run with each character will count as a location as well.

## What is the goal of Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon when randomized?
You will need to reach the true ending! By collecting the 4 Key Fragments you will be able to access the Tower of Fate and defeat the Enchantress.

## What does another world's item look like in Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon?
Items will show up as the Archipelago logo inside of shops, in the camp shop the name of the item will be given before purchasing the item and Chester will let you know how useful the item is, this behaviour can also be optionally enabled for dungeon shops withing your .yaml. The Archipelago logo will appear on shrines as well, items found from boss defeats do not show up in-game.
When picking up an item you will receive an in-game popup that tells you which item has been sent and to what player.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?
You will receive an in-game popup that tells you which item you have received from which player, the sprite of this popup will change to reflect the item you've been given.
