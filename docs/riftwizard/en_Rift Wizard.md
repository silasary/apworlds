# Rift Wizard (PC)

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Mana Dot pickups and some consumables are replaced with Archipelago items and Mana Dots are placed into the pool of item across the
multiworld. The goal can be adjusted to completing a specific floor or remain the normal goal of defeating Mordred.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

Up to 75 Mana Dots are shuffled into the item pool (Mana Dots can be replaced by Double Mana Dots in the settings to
make for an easier overall experience). 3 Mana Dot pickups per floor are replaced by Archipelago item locations and the 
number of total locations is reduced if the goal is based on reaching a lower floor. Consumables can also be replaced
with up to 20 Archipelago item locations which are granted based on a specified "step count". Step count replaces every
X consumable pickup with a check.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

When the player receives an item, you will see the SP (skill points) counter in the top left corner increment up by one
for a Mana Dot or two for a Double Mana Dot. In the case of consumables, the item will be added in the inventory.
The item received will also be displayed in the Rift Wizard Client.

## What happens if a player dies in a run?

If the player dies, they will be taken back to the main menu and will need to begin a new run from the beginning.
They will have access to all the SP from Mana Dots received by them up to that point in the multiworld.
Collecting a previously collected Archipelago item will not grant further checks.
Any regular consumable items found in an earlier run will not be retained similar to the base game,
however consumable items granted by Archipelago checks will be granted again (and will be a randomized consumable).
