# Manual Installation of the Game Mod

## How To

0. Unsubscribe from the [Steam Workshop release of this mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3281191663) if you haven't already.
1. Download the [correct version](https://github.com/MaxReinstadler/WOTCArchipelago/releases) of the mod as `WOTCArchipelago.zip`.
2. Right-click `XCOM 2` in Steam and navigate to `Manage > Browse Local Files`.
3. Unzip the downloaded folder into `/steamapps/common/XCOM 2/XCom2-WarOfTheChosen/XComGame/Mods`.
    - Create the `Mods` folder if it doesn't already exist.
    - The final path should look like this: `/steamapps/common/XCOM 2/XCom2-WarOfTheChosen/XComGame/Mods/WOTCArchipelago/WOTCArchipelago.XComMod`.
4. In [AML](https://github.com/X2CommunityCore/xcom2-launcher), navigate to `Options > Settings` and add the local mod directory that you just used (ending in `/XComGame/Mods`) to `Mod Directories` if it isn't there already.

## Why To

Steam Workshop does not support reverting to previous versions of mods. When a new mod update is published which breaks compatibility with an older version of the apworld, you might therefore need to install the correct mod version manually to continue playing on an existing multiworld.
