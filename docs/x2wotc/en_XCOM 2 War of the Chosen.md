When reaching a location, a notification appears informing the player about the item they found and who it belongs to.

Items are currently only received in the geoscape, including any the player sent to themself. When the game receives an item, a notification appears informing the player about what they got and from whom.

## How was this game adapted to fit into Archipelago?

Various features have been added to reduce the length of a full campaign (such as missions being skipped and soldiers gaining XP passively) and there are multiple options for alternate goals. Expect the game to be comfortably beatable in roughly 15 to 20 hours on default settings, and potentially much quicker if the goal is adjusted.
