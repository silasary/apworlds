# Pokémon Crystal

## What does randomization do to this game?

Some changes have been made to the base game for this randomizer:

- The director is always in the underground warehouse, even when Radio Tower isn't occupied
- The card key door in Goldenrod Department Store B1F unlocks with the Card Key in your Pack
- Time based checks such as the Day of the Week siblings and the Celadon Mansion roof guy are always available
    - The hidden items under Freida and Wesley have been moved a tile across to remain accessible
- The Ship between Olivine and Vermilion is always present in non-Johto-Only-games, even before entering Hall of Fame,
  and available to ride with the S.S. Ticket with no day of week restrictions.
- A ledge on Route 45 has been moved so all items and trainers can be accessed in 2 passthroughs
- For options which enable it, the Kanto badges map to the following HMs:
    - HM01 Cut - Cascade Badge
    - HM02 Fly - Thunder Badge
    - HM03 Surf - Soul Badge
    - HM04 Strength - Rainbow Badge
    - HM05 Flash - Boulder Badge
    - HM06 Whirlpool - Volcano Badge
    - HM07 Waterfall - Earth Badge
- TM02 and TM08 will always be Headbutt and Rock Smash respectively, and are always reusable
- Trade evolutions have been changed to make them possible in a solo run of the game:
    - Regular trade evolutions evolve when the Link Cable key item is used on them
    - Held item trade evolutions evolve when the Link Cable is used on them while they hold their evolution item
- Eevee evolves into Espeon and Umbreon with the Sun Stone and Moon Stone respectively
- Happiness evolutions are logically tied to access to the Goldenrod Underground or Pallet Town. The younger haircut
  brother and Daisy will max out a Pokémon's happiness and are always available
- Unown will only appear in the wild after solving one puzzle in the Ruins of Alph. Prior to that, any encounter that
  would have been Unown will instead play its cry
- Tin Tower 1F is accessible once you obtain the Clear Bell.
- The stairs leading to Tin Tower 2F+ appear once the aforementioned condition is met, and you have the Rainbow Wing.
  Both are items in the multiworld.
- Eusine will give you an Eon Mail if you talk to him in Tin Tower 1F after seeing Suicune in the overworld at all
  possible locations, which you can visit in any order
- The Celebi Event can be activated by giving the multiworld item GS Ball to Kurt after clearing Slowpoke Well and
  defeating the rival in Azalea
- The event which usually grants the GS Ball in Goldenrod Pokécenter 1F activates after becoming champion
- The man who gives a reward for having all badges in Vermilion City only checks for the 8 Kanto badges
- The Ruins of Alph Ho-Oh item chamber is accessible by owning the Rainbow Wing
- A shop has been added to 2F of all Pokémon Centers, you can customise what this shop sells using the `build_a_mart`
  option, the shop will always sell Poké Balls and Escape Ropes
- An NPC which allows you to fight a random wild Pokémon has been added to 2F of all Pokémon Centers, this fight awards
  money and exp, but does not grant Pokédex entries and is not catchable
- If it is randomized, Professor Elm will tell you your goal by talking to him at his lab or calling him
- The "Area" tab of a Pokémon's Pokédex page was enhanced to allow switching between Morn, Day and Nite encounters.
  The map only shows Land and Surf encounters. Fishing, Headbutt, Rock Smash and Bug Catching Contest encounters can
  be viewed on the "More" tab.

## What items and locations get randomized?

By default, items from item balls and items given by NPCs are randomized.
Badges can be either vanilla, shuffled or randomized. Pokégear and its card modules can be vanilla or randomized.
If Johto Only mode is enabled, items in Kanto will not be randomized and Kanto will be inaccessible.
The S.S. Ticket given by Elm after beating the Elite 4 will also be replaced by the Silver Wing.

There are options to include more items in the pool:

- Randomize Hidden Items: Adds hidden items to the pool
- Randomize Berry Trees: Adds berry tree items to the pool
- Trainersanity: Adds a reward for beating trainers to the pool
- Dexsanity: A Pokémon's Dex entry can hold a check. This is tied to specific Pokémon

## What does another world's item look like in Pokémon Crystal?

Items from other worlds will print the item name and the name of the receiving player when collected. Due to
limitations with the game's text, these names are truncated at 16 characters, and special characters not found in the
font are replaced with question marks.

With the `colored_item_balls` option, overworld item balls will also have a different color depending on the item's
classification.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

The "AP Item Notify" in-game option can play a sound and/or show a popup when an item is received. Different sounds
will play to distinguish progression items and traps. Items can be received both in the overworld and in battle.

## Can I play offline?

Yes, the game does not need to be connected to the client for solo seeds. Connection is only required for sending and
receiving items. This does not apply when `remote_items` is enabled.

## Can I play in co-op?

Yes, the vast majority of story events and caught Pokémon will be synchronized across all clients when `remote_items`
is enabled. Players can use the "Tracker Slot" in-game setting to prevent interference when auto-tracking maps.
