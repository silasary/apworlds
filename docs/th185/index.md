# Black Market of Bulletphilia ~ 100th Black Market

The marketplace god spoke.
&quot;The Ability Cards will inevitably spread, inevitably become obsolete,
and the market will return to its everyday routine.&quot;
But contrary to the god&#x27;s intent, the value of the cards is somehow rising further and further.
Could someone be manipulating their value?
Or could it be because a select few collectors are buying up all the stock?
When the card market had reached the utter peak of chaos,
markets that the god couldn&#x27;t intervene in--&quot;black markets&quot;--began to open.
