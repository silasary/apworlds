## What does randomization do to this game?

Levels, Masks, Cages, Silver Lums, and Super Yellow Lums are all moved around.

The order of levels and rooms will change, they are mostly random with a few conditions:
- The Prison Ship and Crow's Nest are always the last two levels.
- Menhir Hills #2 will always appear after the Marshes of Awakening #1.

Masks, Cage Contents, Silver Lums, and Super Yellow Lums are all randomised between each other. When you destroy a cage its contents are what is randomised, so you may not be able to acquire all lums in a level if the cage contained lums. Cages that contain teensies are not randomised.
