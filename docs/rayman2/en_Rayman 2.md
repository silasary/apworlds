## What are checks in this game?

The following things count as checks:
- Picking up Yellow Lums and Super Yellow Lums
- Destroying Cages
- Receiving Silver Lums
- Obtaining Masks
- Obtaining the Elixir of Life
- Finishing the game

The regular tracking showing what you've picked up will match your save game, but any time the game checks if you have them it will instead use items received from other games. The following things are checked against other games:

- If you select 100% mode you need to have 1000 lums and 80 cages received to finish the story
- Whether you can give Clark the Elixir of Life in Menhir Hills is based on if you received the item
- The power of your shots is based on received silver lums

## What does randomization do to this game?

When the game is randomised sub-levels are shuffled around. Levels may be built up of any randomised sub levels inside. The contents of cages are not changed.
