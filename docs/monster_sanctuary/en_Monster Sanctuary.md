# Monster Sanctuary

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

The items and monsters the player would normally encounter throughout the game have been moved around.
The randomizer logic is such that the game is always able to be completed, but the player may be required
to venture in certain areas of the game before they would in the vanilla game.

## What is the goal of Monster Sanctuary when randomized?

The default goal is to defeat the Mad Lord (the same as the base game). Other goals include:
- Win all battles against Legendary Keepers

## What items and locations get shuffled?

Items found in chests or received from NPCs are randomized. Monsters are also randomized, with their 
explore abilities included in the randomizer's logic. Additional options can further modify the way
the game is randomized.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Most items may be shuffled into another player's world.

## What does another world's item look like in Subnautica?

Location checks in Monster Sanctuary are chests and items given by NPCs. Acquiring one of these will send 
an item to another player's world.

## When the player receives a item, what happens?

You get the item.
