# Jak II

Jak II is an action-adventure game published by Naughty Dog in 2003 for the PlayStation 2.
Set directly after the events of Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy, Jak, Daxter, Samos
and Keira have set up the Rift Rider they found at the end of their previous adventure, and
are ready to see where it leads. However, a strange and hostile species of creatures known as
Metal Heads suddenly fly through the portal, and in a panic, Daxter activates the machine,
sending them flying through the open portal. Separated, they find themselves in &quot;glorious&quot; Haven City,
and Jak is quickly captured. Two years later, Daxter finds Jak locked up in prison,
and Jak has only one thought on his mind: vengeance.
