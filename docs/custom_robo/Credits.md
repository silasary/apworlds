
A special thanks to all of the following:

Testers, for helping break the game so that we can fix it and build up the Custom Robo AP to be as great as possible

Our Archi squad, who I always enjoy running the monthly AP Asyncs with

Kilios, for bringing the gang together and making Archipelago look SO dang fun that I had to join and check it out

And finally TheMogul, who not only authored the Megaman X Command Mission AP World but inspired me through his efforts to take the same leap into AP World development
