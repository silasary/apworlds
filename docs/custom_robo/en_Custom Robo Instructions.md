
# Custom Robo

## Where is the settings page?

A YAML has been provided for Testing - It currently only contains a setting for starting parts
- Starting items will either be the Ray01 set (default) or a random part for each Robo category that will need to be selected before the first battle

## What counts as a check for Custom Robo?

- First-time use of all parts (they'll be yellow in-game until you've won a battle using that part)
- Every battle is a check (note: the final chapter has "optional" battles, so those are not specifically labelled yet)

## Which items can be in another player's world?
- Robo Parts (the game is currently not progression locked, so you can play start to finish... requiring you can win with the parts you have, of course)
- Rahu Evolution (Each part of Rahu is gained in a Progressive system within the AP World, so more evolution means your Rahu access gets stronger!)
  - Rahu I
  - Penumbra I Pod
  - Rahu I Gun
  - Rahu II
  - Penumbra II Pod
  - Rahu II Gun
  - Grand Cross Bomb
  - Ultimate Legs
  - Penumbra III Pod
  - Rahu III Gun
  - Rahu III

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

The AP World currently circumvents the Parts Generator, so you'll receive the parts directly in your inventory

## Changes from the vanilla game

Aside from the Parts Generator, all other function is still standard to vanilla (currently). "A New Journey" is the only mode currently implemented.

## What is my "go-mode?"

You can beat the game from the start! The main limiter for Custom Robo currently is whether you can win battles given your current part set... there's a few rough ones

## How Do I Win?
To win Custom Robo, you must reach the end of the game by defeating the greatest threat to humanity: Rahu

When Rahu is defeated once and for all, you win!
