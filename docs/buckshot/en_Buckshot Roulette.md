# Buckshot Roulette

## Where is the options page?

There is currently no options page. Use the .yaml file to choose your settings.

## What does randomization do to this game?

All consumable items (such as the Magnifying Glass) must be unlocked by finding the item in a
randomly placed location throughout the multiworld before they can be drawn from the item box.
Furthermore, depending on settings, the player may need to obtain the "Double or Nothing Pills"
item to unlock the ability to play Double or Nothing mode.

The locations in which items could appear within Buckshot Roulette include round completions
in both the main game and Double or Nothing mode. Additionally, depending on player settings,
achievements and successful shots can also be added as locations.

Furthermore, custom mechanics can be added to the game. Details about these custom mechanics
can be found in the player settings.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

As mentioned previously, all consumable items and the double or nothing pills will be shuffled.
Filler items are also shuffled into the item pool. Gameplay is not affected when obtaining
these items.

## What happens when the player receives an item?

If a filler item is found, nothing will happen.

If a consumable item is found, you will be able to obtain the item the next time you draw items.

If the pills are found, you will be able to play Double or Nothing mode after returning to the
main menu and clicking "Start."
