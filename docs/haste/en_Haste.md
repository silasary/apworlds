# Haste

## What does randomization do to this game?

Shards are locked behind an unlock item. Abilites are shuffled into the item pool. Buy an item at a shop and beat the boss per shard to check an item into the ap world.
You will need the [Archipelgo randomizer mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3462307025) on steam.

## What are the Items in this ApWorld?

- Progressive Shard: Unlocks the next shard
- Ability (Slomo, Grapple, Fly): Give the player that ability.
- Anti-Spark Bundle: Give you an amount of anti-sparks

## What location are in the ApWorld?

- Shard x Boss: Defeating the boss in shard x.
- Shard x Shop Item: Buy any item in a shop in shard x. (1 per shard)
- Ability Slomo, Grapple, Fly: Getting the ability from the respective character in the hub.

## What is the goal of Haste?

The goal of Haste is to beat the end boss of the final shard.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

The item will imdeitaly come into affect. If force reload is enabled and you are in the hub, getting a progressive shard will reload the hub to unlock the next shard.
