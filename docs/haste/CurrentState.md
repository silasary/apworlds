# Current State of the World

Haste AP is in a relatively stable place at the moment. There are many things still planned to be implemented over time, but the majority of the big/important settings have been implemented to create a nice little experience.

Updates are admittedly slow to release (I have other hobbies), but be assured that I am steadily chipping away at it when I can.

## Settings

### Currently Available Settings
In brief, the following settings are currently available:
- Shard Goal: Set which boss contains the win condition
- Shard Unlocks: Sets if Shard unlocks require both the item and the corresponding boss clear
- Shopsanity: Checks on certain shop purchases
- Fragmentsanity: Checks on Fragment clears
  - The rate of Fragment clears needed to obtain the check can also be modified in various ways
- Fashion Weeboh Purchases: Checks on costume purchases
- Captain's Upgrades: Checks on upgrade purchases; upgrades as items in the pool
- NPC Shuffle: Hub NPCs as items in the pool
- Starting Ability Shuffle: Changes the starting ability to any of the four options, or none at all
- Speed Upgrades: Reduces base speed to 60%, items that increase base speed up to 120% in the pool
- Persistent Items: In-game Haste items (grouped by rarity & function) in the pool
- Default Costume: Sets hat and body costume independently
- Unlock All Items: Unlocks all mid-run items
- Anti-Spark Filler: Determines how generous the filler items are for granting Anti-Sparks
- Traps: Debuffs that activate at the start of a Fragment and last until the player dies or completes that Fragment
  - Disaster: Adds the Disaster Shard Level 1 effects (lava flowers & health loss on low speed)
  - Landing Downgrade: Downgrades any landing performed (Perfect -> Good, Good -> Ok, Ok -> Bad)
- Deathlink


### Future Planned Settings
In brief, the following settings and mod features are planned to be (**but not guaranteed to be**) implemented at some point in the future. This list is unordered in terms of priority and some features may take longer to implement than others.
- Taglink
- More trap types
- Always fight the final boss during your Shard Goal's boss encounter, even if the Goal isn't Shard 10
- Skipping Sanity checks that have already been collected by other players finishing
- Text input support for in-game client (to remove reliance on multiple windows)
- In-game UI to indicate how many checks are available in a given location
- In-game toggle to enable/disable Deathlink
- Some sort of handling for both Endless Shard and the Disaster Shards (very unsure on the implementation)
- Fix bugs
- More things that will inevitably be suggested as more people play Haste

## Client

The message log is a colourized on-screen display, where all AP messages are displayed. The placement of this log can be customized in-game to several positions on-screen.
This client currently does **not** support text input, so any hinting or other chatting will need to be done via another AP Text Client.

# Message

Thank you all for spending the time to enjoy this.

If you could star this repo that would mean a lot to me, I like numbers to go up.

If you feel something is wrong with this file let me know so I can fix it. If it is wrong here then its is highly likely that I don't know about it.
