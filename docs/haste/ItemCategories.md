# Item Categories

As of Haste AP v0.4.0, Persistent Items have been added, granting the player a number of items at the start of each Shard. To avoid having 100 unique items in the pool, the items have been broken down by rarity/function into the following categories:
- Common Speed (9)
- Common Support (11)
- Common Health (15)
- Rare Speed (14)
- Rare Support (7)
- Rare Health (12)
- Epic Speed (10)
- Epic Support (6)
- Epic Health (7)
- Legendary (11)

Some items have multiple purposes, and therefore fall into multiple categories. Legendary items are bundled into a single category for simplicity due to their low total counts.

Items may be recategorized if there is enough demand for it.
