# Codeforces Randomizer Setup Guide


## Required Software

- [Archipelago](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases/latest)
- [The Codeforces apworld](https://github.com/glipR/Archipelago/releases),
  if not bundled with your version of Archipelago

## How to play

First, you need a room to connect to. For this, you or someone you know has to generate a game.
This will not be explained here,
but you can check the [Archipelago Setup Guide](/tutorial/Archipelago/setup_en#generating-a-game).

You also need to have [Archipelago](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases/latest) installed
and the [The Codeforces apworld](https://github.com/glipR/Archipelago/releases) installed into Archipelago.

From here, connecting to your Codeforces slot is easy. There are two scenarios.

### Step 1A: Webhost Room

If your room is hosted on a WebHost (e.g. [archipelago.gg](https://archipelago.gg)),
you should be able to simply click on your name in the player list.
This will open the Archipelago Launcher
and ask you whether you want to connect with the Text Client or the Codeforces Client.
Choose "Codeforces Client". The rest should happen completely automatically and you should be able to play Codeforces.

### Step 1B: Locally hosted room

If your room does not have a WebHost room page available, you can launch the Codeforces client manually.

Open the Archipelago Launcher, and then select the Codeforces Client from the list.
After a short while, the Codeforces client should open.
Enter the server address at the top and click "Connect".
Then, enter your name. If a password exists, enter the password.
You should now be connected and able to play Codeforces.

### Step 2: Configure

Upon connecting, you should get prompted to open a configuration file (if not - just click the file icon in the top-right of the Codeforces tab).

Here you'll need to enter your Codeforces handle so we can see your latest submissions to Codeforces.

You also have the option of entering in a Codeforces API Key.
If this is not entered, then the restrictions on your submission code - such as Memory Upgrades, will not be respected.

As such you'd need to verify your submission meets the rules before submitting!

## Switching Rooms

The Codeforces Client can seamlessly switch rooms without restarting.

Simply click the "Disconnect" button, then connect to a different slot/room.
