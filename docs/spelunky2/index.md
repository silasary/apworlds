# Spelunky 2

Spelunky 2 is an extremely difficult roguelike platformer where your progression is gated by multiworld unlocks.
Your ultimate goal is to complete one of the game&#x27;s various paths. Your primary objective is to complete &#x27;checks&#x27; by
discovering new journal entries, which sends an item from the multiworld into the item pool. The rewards you receive
can range from simple &#x27;filler&#x27; items to world unlocks that allow you to progress, as well as key quest-chain items
like the Udjat Eye and Hou Yi&#x27;s Bow. These critical items must be received from the multiworld before you can obtain
them in-game.
