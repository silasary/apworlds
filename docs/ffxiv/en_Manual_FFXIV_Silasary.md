# Manual

## What is Final Fantasy XIV?
Have you heard of the critically acclaimed MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV with a randomizer which can shuffle through the entirety of A Realm Reborn, and the award-winning expansions Heavensward, Stormblood, Shadowbringers, Endwalker and Dawntrail up to level 100 with many restrictions shuffled into your multiworld?


## Where is the settings page?
The player settings page for this game is located <a href="../player-settings">here</a>. It contains all the options
you need to configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?
As the game is an MMO, we can't actually randomize gameplay elements.  As such, we're overlaying a bunch of manual restrictions onto your playthrough.

Your locations (checks) are to complete various tasks and duties within the game.  These can range from Dungeons and fates, all the way to catching fish or visiting the Waking Sands.  Don't worry, there are many settings to enable/disable checks, you don't need to do things you're not going to enjoy.

Your items are increases to a soft level cap, access to new zones, and permission to use specific baits and lures (if fishsanity is enabled)

## What is the goal of a Manual game when randomized?
The goal is to achieve a "Victory" condition, which is available in the location list in the client. What that Victory condition is... is up to you! It can be beating the game, beating a subset of the game, checking all locations, race to get to an important objective, etc.

## Which items can be in another player's world?
All of the items that you specify in your item list can be in another player's world.

## What if I have items, unlocks, or locations that I'd like to not have randomized?
It's all manual. Just exclude them from either the item or location list.

## How do I install the mod for a Manual game?
You don't. There is no mod. The tasks of marking locations as checked and limiting your items used based on items received is all performed by you (the player) while using the Manual client and its accompanying tracker.
