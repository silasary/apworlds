# Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes

## Warning

This game currently doesn't work with macOS and Linux. Only windows is fully supported as of now.

## Where is the options page?

Since this game isn't fully released yet, the only way to set options is through a YAML file. Please refer to the setup 
guide for more information on how to access it.

## What does randomization do to this game?

This randomizer shuffles modules, time upgrades, strike augments and bomb fragments. It features a custom new 
playthrough that is more specific and locks more of the game. 

## What is the goal of KTANE when randomized?

The goal is to finish mission "6.1 - The Final Challenge". To do so, the player needs all the modules that would be 
present on the bomb, some more time and 50 Bomb Fragments.

## What is considered a location check in KTANE?

Location checks are completed by solving modules in the missions. Also, completing all bombs in a section grants the 
player an additional check.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any of the following items can be in another player's world
 - Any modules (except The Button, Wires and Keypad, since you start with them)
 - Bomb Fragments (used to unlock new sections)
 - Timer++ (adds 30 seconds to your timers)
 - Timer+ (adds 10 seconds to your timers)
 - Strike+ (add a strike to your bombs' limits)

## What does another world's item look like in KTANE?

Items are not visible in KTANE.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

If it's a module, the tracker page shows the module as got and the manual for this module is now unlocked in the Expert 
Manuals Client.

If it's a Bomb Fragment, the counter at the top right of every section will increment. If it goes over the required 
number of fragments, the next section will be unlocked.

If it's a Time++, a Time+ or a Strike+, missions will now have more time or strikes to them when loading them from the 
tablet.
