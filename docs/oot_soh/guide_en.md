# Ship of Harkinian Setup Guide

## Required Software

- Until AP is integrated into the main Ship of Harkinian releases, a separate version of Ship of Harkinian including it (see releases [here](https://github.com/HarbourMasters/Archipelago-SoH/releases)). Windows, Linux (including Steam Deck) and Mac are supported!
- An Ocarina of Time ROM. Every version of OoT is supported!
- If hosting or wanting to generate the default yaml yourself, the .apworld also found on our releases page.


## Installation

### Installing Ship of Harkinian

Please follow the instructions in the README that comes with your Ship of Harkinian download to get SoH set-up. The SoH discord also has a guide to help you 
extracting your ROM from whichever physical copy you own. If you want to know more about Ship of Harkinian itself, please check out the [Ship of Harkinian](https://www.shipofharkinian.com/) website.


### How to play Archipelago on Ship of Harkinian

In Ship or Harkinian's quest select menu, select Archipelago. Follow the on-screen instructions. After creating the save file, this file will be 
linked to your Archipelago slot and will automatically try to connect when loaded.

In the ESC menu you can find the built-in Archipelago console. To find this, navigate to the "Network" tab, then "Archipelago" in the sidebar.

Co-op play on the same slot is available! Just make a save file with the same slot details, and locations will automatically get synced between players.

Please take a look at the other options inside the ESC menu to tweak your experience. Pretty much every regular SoH enhancement will work perfectly fine within
Archipelago saves, including all the trackers, installed graphical mods and QoL enhancements!


### Updating Ship of Harkinian Archipelago

If you have already played SoH AP with an older version and wish to update, take note of the version difference. Our versioning logic goes as follows: x.0.0 and 0.x.0 version differences mean you'll need to update your client as well as the APWorld. 0.0.x version differences are APWorld only updates, and most often you only need to update the .apworld and sometimes your yaml. 

Examples: When your client is version 1.1.0, and you want to update to 1.2.0, that means you'll need to update both your client and your APWorld. When your client version is 1.2.0, and you're updating to 1.2.1, you only need to update the APWorld.

To update your SoH client, simply download the newer version, and extract + overwrite all the .zip contents into your existing folder.


## Configure Archipelago Options

### Configure Your YAML File

In the Archipelago launcher, choose "Install APWorld" and pick the "oot_soh.apworld" file that came with your download. Afterwards, in the Archipelago launcher,
choose "Generate Template Options". This will generate .yamls inside your Archipelago installation folder under "Players/Templates". Find the "Ship of Harkinian.yaml"
file and edit it with your text editor of choosing. Change anything in there to your liking! If using Archipelago 0.6.5 or later, you can also use the built-in Options
editor which you can find inside the Archipelago Launcher itself.
