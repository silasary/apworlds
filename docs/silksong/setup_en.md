# Hollow Knight: Silksong Archipelago Randomizer

This is an Archipelago randomizer for Hollow Knight: Silksong.

It randomizes items, abilities, maps, bosses, quests, resources, Bellways,
and other checks between all players in an Archipelago multiworld.

## Requirements

- Archipelago 0.6.7
- The matching `silksong.apworld`
- The matching BepInEx plugin
- A fresh Archipelago room and Silksong randomizer save

The APWorld, game plugin, and generated room should use compatible versions.

## Installation

1. Install Archipelago.
2. Copy `silksong.apworld` into Archipelago's `custom_worlds` folder.
3. Install the matching Silksong BepInEx plugin.
4. Generate a room using the provided Silksong YAML.
5. Launch Silksong and connect using the generated server, slot name, and
   password.
6. Start a new save slot for the randomizer.

The first launch must be online so the save can bind itself to the correct
room, player slot, goal, and starting crest.

Vanilla saves remain separate from randomizer saves. Disable or remove the
plugin to access them normally.

## Goals

The available goals are:

- `act_2`: Defeat Grand Mother Silk. Hand-tested unavailable sources and their
  matching reward copies are omitted. When Skills are randomized, Silk Soar
  stays in the item pool while its Abyss source is omitted.
- `act_3`: Complete the Lost Lace route. This is the default.
- `flea_hunt`: Receive the required number of distinct randomized AP Fleas.

For Flea Hunt, set `flea_hunt_count` from 1 to 30 in the YAML (default 20).
The 30 AP Fleas are the 27 ordinary Fleas plus Kratt, Vog, and Huge Flea; all
three named NPC Fleas count toward the goal. Flea Hunt requires Flea
randomization to be set to `shuffle` or `anywhere`.

## Randomization modes

Most categories support three modes:

- `vanilla`: Keep the original item at its original source.
- `shuffle`: Shuffle items within their own category.
- `anywhere`: Mix the category into the general item pool.

Some newer categories, such as Memory Lockets, Craftmetal, Mossberries,
Silkeaters, and named progression keys, support only `vanilla` or `anywhere`.
`pollip_heart_randomization` supports all three modes. Its six finite Pollip
Hearts form an exact `shuffle` lane, and Pollip Pouch requires all six while
the category is randomized.

Simple Keys are destination-specific. A Wormways Key only opens the Wormways
door, a Deep Docks Key only opens the Deep Docks door, and so on.

## Important options

- `starting_crest`: Choose the starting Crest or use `random`.
- `early_dash`: Place the required Swift Step progression early.
- `split_dash_and_sprint`: Split Swift Step into separate Sprint and Dash items.
- `randomize_needle_upgrades`: Randomize Needle Upgrades and Pale Oil.
- `mossberry_randomization`: Randomize the seven finite Mossberries.
- `pollip_heart_randomization`: Randomize the six finite Pollip Hearts.
- `start_with_maps`: Start with most maps already collected.
- `automatic_compass`: Enable map positioning without randomizing the Compass.
- `easy_skips`: Allow only movement shortcuts explicitly marked as safe.
- `quest_sanity`: Add side-quest completion checks.
- `lore_tablet_hints`: Reserved for a future MMR-inspired hint system; not
  currently functional.
- `death_link`: Share deaths with other DeathLink players.
- `silk_link`, `rosary_link`, and `shell_shard_link`: Experimental shared
  resource systems for players on the same team.
- `trap_percentage`: Convert some filler items into traps.

## Price randomization

Six independent settings control prices for normal shops, Bellways, maps,
pins, paid Needle upgrades, and donation Wishes:

- `vanilla`: Keep every shipped price.
- `free`: Charge zero currency.
- `shuffled`: Permute shipped prices within the same purchase family and
  currency.
- `cheap`: Roll each price from 1 through 100.
- `expensive`: Roll Rosary prices from 1 through 500 and Shell Shard prices
  from 1 through 800.

The settings are `normal_shop_prices`, `bellway_prices`, `map_prices`,
`pin_prices`, `upgrade_prices`, and `donation_prices`. Prices are resolved
once from the generated seed. A purchase always keeps its original currency,
stock conditions, and separate item costs such as Craftmetal or Pale Oil.

## In-game controls

- `F3`: Open or close the connection window.
- `F4`: Return to the best unlocked hub: Terminus after the full Act 3
  introduction, Songclave, Bellhart, Greymoor after riding with the Flea
  Caravan, or Bone Bottom.
- `F8` in Logic Audit mode only: Cycle physical cloak testing through
  Cloakless, Normal, Drifter's, and Faydown. The audit overlay shows the
  active state.
- The connection window contains the same dynamic hub-return button.

F4 and F8 are disabled during unsafe menus, cutscenes, and transitions. F4 is
also disabled throughout both stages of the Act 3 wake-up sequence. F8 never
changes the AP items actually owned by the save.

## Map markers

When enabled, the map can show randomized checks at their physical locations.

Markers indicate whether a check is currently reachable, out of logic, or has
a cached hint. They do not reveal the item, recipient, item classification, or
trap status.

## Troubleshooting

If the game refuses to connect or load a save, check that:

- The APWorld, plugin, and room versions match.
- The server, team, slot name, and password are correct.
- You are using a new randomizer save slot.
- The save was initially started while connected to the server.
