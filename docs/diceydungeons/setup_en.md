## How to play

First, you need a room to connect to. For this, you or someone you know has to generate a game.  
This will not be explained here,
but you can check the [Archipelago Setup Guide](/tutorial/Archipelago/setup_en#generating-a-game).

Download Dicey Dungeons (current patch) and start it at least once.

Room generation will create an archive containing a folder named "diceyap". Place this in the games local files, under the "mod" directory.

Launch the Dicey Dungeons Client from Archipelago, add the URL:Port and your slot name, and Connect.

Launch the game with /dicey, and you're off and running!
