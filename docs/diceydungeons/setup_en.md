## How to play

First, you need a room to connect to. For this, you or someone you know has to generate a game.  
This will not be explained here,
but you can check the [Archipelago Setup Guide](/tutorial/Archipelago/setup_en#generating-a-game).

1. Download Dicey Dungeons (current patch).

1. Launch the Dicey Dungeons Client from Archipelago. On launch, it may require you to navigate to your Dicey Dungeons installation 
path in a file browser. Please select the root folder of the install ("Dicey Dungeons"). 
    - For Steam users, this will likely be at (Windows) `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Dicey Dungeons`

1. Inside the Client, add the URL:Port and Connect, then provide your Slot name.

1. Patch your local installation with client command `/patch`.

1. Launch the game with `/dicey`, and you're off and running!

## Helpful commands

- `!missing Completed` will show you which episodes still need to be beaten.
