# Dicey Dungeons

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Your pool of items (equipment) which you can acquire throughout your runs has been turned into AP items, which are added back into your pool when you receive the item. NOTE: Items gained will only be added to the pool for future runs, because of how this game generates episodes.

## What characters are supported?

Phase 1 of this project is focusing only on the Warrior, as its layout is the simplest. In the future, other characters or episodes may be included.

## What is the goal of Dicey Dungeons when randomized?

For phase 1, the goal is to clear all 6 episodes for the Warrior.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

All items in the item pool will get shuffled, and will only be re-added when the item is received. Locations will be (if configured) chests, shops, and episode completion.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any of the items which can be shuffled may also be placed into another player's world.

## What does another world's item look like in Dicey Dungeons?

An item belonging to another world will show up as a Gray equipment box, featuring the item's name.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

For phase 1... nothing. The item is added to the pool behind the scenes, and it will appear in future generations of episodes.
