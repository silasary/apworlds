# Dicey Dungeons

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Your pool of items (equipment) which you can acquire throughout your runs has been turned into AP items, which are added back into your pool when you receive the item. NOTE: Items gained will only be added to the pool for future runs, not your current run.

## What characters are supported?

The Warrior is the only character supported by this mod. Other characters are present, but playing their Episodes will not benefit you.

## What is the goal of Dicey Dungeons when randomized?

The game is Completed once you have beaten all 6 episodes for the Warrior.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

All items in the item pool will get shuffled, and will only be re-added when the item is received. Locations will be (if configured) chests, shops, trades, and Level ups.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any of the items which can be shuffled may also be placed into another player's world.

## What does another world's item look like in Dicey Dungeons?

An item belonging to another world will show up as a Gray equipment box, featuring the item's name, its owner in the multiworld, and some flavor text about how important it (probably) is.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

Your Client will report receiving the item, and the item will be added to future episode generation, but your current run will not be affected in any way.
