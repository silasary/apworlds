# Skyward Sword

What if that&#x27;s Zelda down there, and she&#x27;s sending me a signal? It&#x27;s a sign!
It says, `Save me, Groose. You&#x27;re my only hope!`
The more I think about it, the more sure I get! It&#x27;s Zelda down there, and I gotta go rescue her!

Anyhow, don&#x27;t think about trying to go down there before me. I&#x27;m her hero, remember?

Ugh. I don&#x27;t even know why I&#x27;m talking to you. Looking at you just makes me feel sad again.
