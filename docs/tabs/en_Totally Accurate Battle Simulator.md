# Totally Accurate Battle Simulator

## What is Totally Accurate Battle Simulator?

Totally Accurate Battle Simulator is a strategy game where you assemble armies made from a variety of units of
different factions in order to fight another army. The physics system for these battles is, of course, "Totally
Accurate".

The main mode of the game is the campaign where you can view and attempt to fight pre-created enemy armies within a
given budget. To win, you'll have to strategize around the army you're facing and create an effective counter.
There's several campaigns available with different maps and factions available, including a few unlockable secrets.

## How does randomization affect this game?

The goal of the game when randomized is to beat a certain set of the campaigns (by default, Introduction, Adventure,
and Challenge). Instead of the usual set of units to place in campaign levels, units must first be received as items,
with only the Clubber available to start with by default.

Clearing each available campaign level is a check, and so are the hidden objects around the maps if Secret Location Type
is set (make sure to check Sandbox for hidden maps or if secret locations is set to all).
