## What kind of game is this?

Paquerette Down The Bunburrows is a sokoban-inspired top down puzzle game, about collecting bunnies.
A *sokobun* if you will.

The player, as Paquerette, will chase bunnies.  The bunnies will try to flee.

The game will teach you some of the basics starting out, but players will be expected to pay attention
and learn various bunny behaviors.

## I'm still in, what should I know about the client?

See the Setup guide for more details on installation and logging in.

Paquerette Down The Bunburrows generally gives players all the tools they need to solve any particular room, 
and players may progress as they see fit with few restrictions.

The Archipelago implementation steals Paquerette's tools.  Each toolset within a room is an Archipelago item to be unlocked.
Each bunny to capture, conversely, is an Archipelago location to check.

Unlocked rooms behave as normal in the 

Playing alone, capturing bunnies grants you various rooms tools.

While the base game generally allows you to skip puzzles freely, playing in Archipelago will very likely gatekeep your progress 
behind very specific puzzles, or there many be only one bunny you can capture at a time.

Last to note, there is a **new Computer Tab** in the in-game computer for tracking Archipelago unlocks.
This can show what tools you have unlocked so far.


## Archipelago Items and Locations

### Basics

1. Bunnies are locations.  Capturing bunnies qualifies as checking the location.
These locations are named after the Bunny's "Identity.
A bunny's identity tells you what room they are in, and which bunny they are:

Bunny identity **W-6-2** would be the **2nd** bunny in room **W-6**

2. Tools for various rooms are item.  These items are named after the rooms they unlock the tools for.
Unlocking **N-4** means you now have tools available in room **N-6**


### Fluffle

**Fluffle** is the go-to junk item for this game.  If you capture a bunny and find Fluffle, the congratulations you get nothing!

**Golden Fluffle**, is specifically used for the **Golden Fluffle* victory condition, 
where some number of **Golden Fluffles** are distributed through your world to be located.

These will only distribute within Paquerette Down The Bunburrows, so someone else cannot win your game for you.



### Traps

There are two forms of traps avaiable:

- **Surface Teleport Trap**:  Returns the player to the surface, as if they used their own *bunny superpower* to do so.  
Mildly inconvenient at times.

- **Elevator Trap**: Sends the player into an unskippable Elevator scene, where they are eventually forced back into the shop.
The depth of the Elevator is configurable - and for the daring, there are options to increase the Elevator length every trip.


## How does Death Link work?

There is no dying in Paquerette Down The Bunburrows, so this client never sends deaths.
Instead, when someone else dies, Paquerette will act as if it recieved one of the traps:
- Sent to the surface, or
- Sent to an Elevator

This is configurable in the options.


## Options


### Home Captures Only:
**Considerd an Experts Only option**
Enable this to ensure that only Home Captures count as true location checks.

### Golden Fluffles:

When randomizing, Expert Routing may result in games that require complicated, challenging, or unintuitive routes or captures.
For example, **N-4** can be home-captured without **N-4** tools, but the method involved is complicated.

    If the window does not close after this, please close it manually with Task Manager as needed.
