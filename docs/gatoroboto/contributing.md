# Contributing

All contributions are welcome, though we have a few requests of contributors:

* **Follow styling guidelines.**
  Please take a look at the [Archipelago code style documentation](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/blob/main/docs/style.md) to ensure ease of communication and uniformity.

* **When reviewing PRs, please leave a message about what was done.**
  We don't have full test coverage, so manual testing can help.
  Please also tell us if you looked at code, just did functional testing, did both, or did neither.
  If testing the PR depends on other PRs, please state what you merged into what for testing.
  We cannot determine what "LGTM" means without additional context, so that should not be the norm.

For other questions, feel free to explore the [main documentation folder](/docs), and ask us questions in the 
[#future-game-design > Gato Roboto](https://discord.com/channels/731205301247803413/1205195046689841217) thread of the [Archipelago Discord](https://archipelago.gg/discord).
