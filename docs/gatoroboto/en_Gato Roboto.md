## Where is the options page?

Visit the [options page for this game](../player-options) to generate a YAML file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Currently the randomizer supports item and event randomization. There are also options to include skips and/or sequence breaks, such as **Rocket Jumping**, to vary the logic.

The default goal is to **Defeat Gary**, which is identical to the vanilla experience. No other goals exist currently, but future plans include **All Cartridges** and **100%** as alternative and longer gameplay experiences.

## What items and locations get randomized?

By default, all of the following are randomized:
- Healthkits
- Cartridges
- Upgrade Modules
- Progressive Events (Aqueducts' Treadmills, Heater Core's Hotboys and Heater Tubes, Ventilation's Buttons)
- Rebba's Shop

A future update will enable options to disable shuffling of these individual item groups.

Visit the [options page](../player-options) for a comprehensive list of items and locations and what changes you can make to the game.

## What other changes are made to the game?

A few quality of life improvements have been made to the base game:
- A single save slot exists to contain the AP save, to avoid save file issues.
- Starting a new game now places Kiki directly in the mech room, allowing the player immediate access to the mech suit.
- Tutorial dialogs (intro, swimming, mech, etc.) have been removed.
- Warps have been added to the pause menu, allowing players to warp to any area they've previously been to.
- All collectible item sprites have been replaced with the AP icon.
- WARNING: USE WITH CAUTION. Press F12 to enable/disable the debug menu in the pause menu rotation. Keys 1-9 can also be used to increment the debug menu options.
