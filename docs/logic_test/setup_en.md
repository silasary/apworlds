# Logic Test: logic-leak tester

Logic Test is a diagnostic slot you add **alongside one or more games-under-test**
to surface logic leaks, places where the generator's logic model is looser than
the real game (an access rule that says a location is reachable when it isn't).

## How it works

With `<game(s)> + Logic Test`, the Logic Test:

1. Generates all the under-test slots **together** as one nested multiworld (same
   options, same per-game seeds) and reads their **overall** (cross-game) spheres,
   i.e. which items become reachable, in what order, across all of them.
2. Pulls **all of those games' items** out and locks them inside itself (each
   recreated for its original owner), split into gated **spheres**.
3. Replaces every under-test location with a `KEY_i` macguffin, `N_i` of them in
   sphere `i`.
4. Gates Logic Test sphere `i` behind receiving `N_i` copies of `KEY_i`, which
   releases all of sphere `i`'s original items.

Play is forced into lock-step with the intended overall spheres, and **every
check matters**: to open sphere `i` you must collect every `KEY_i` (across all
games). If a rule leaks, a `KEY_i` the model thinks is reachable won't be
in-game, the next sphere never opens, and you hard-stall at the leaked point.

A stall catches the model being **looser** than the game. The reverse (model
**tighter** than the game) is caught by a marker: any under-test location the
model never reaches in progression gets a `Logic Test Unreachable Marker` instead
of a `KEY`. That location is unreachable in the reproduced structure too, so
picking a marker up in play means the real game let you reach something the model
proved unreachable, another kind of leak. Under full accessibility every reachable
location is gated, so markers appear only when `accessibility` (minimal/items)
leaves locations off the required path.

## Setup

1. Add one Logic Test slot plus one or more games-under-test. Slot order does not
   matter.
2. Generate normally (`python Generate.py`) and host the resulting seed.

## Options

- **`count_events`** (default off): whether in-game events cause a sphere
  boundary.
  - **Off** (default): events never create a boundary (the canonical
    sendable-sphere grouping), so spheres are coarser. Events are still collected
    in dependency order, so this stays solvable.
  - **On**: an item unlocked by an event creates a boundary, so spheres are
    finer-grained and faithful to real play order.

## Playing

- Play player 1 with its normal client/emulator.
- Run the Logic Test client (Launcher → **Logic Test Client**, or
  `python -m worlds.logic_test.client --name "<logic test slot>" <server>`).
- Use the **Logic Test** tab: it shows the current sphere, how many `KEY`s you
  have vs. need, and an **Open Sphere** button that lights up once you have them
  all. (The `/status` and `/proceed` console commands do the same.) Opening a
  sphere releases that sphere's original items back to player 1.

A correct game flows sphere by sphere to completion. A leak = `/proceed` never
becomes available because a key is unreachable in-game.

> Only real, networkable progression is gated. Event-style logic (gym clears,
> flags) stays in the under-test game and resolves through normal play.

## Limitations

The Logic Test relocates the under-test game's progression out of the main fill. If a
game places **real (networked) progression items in its own `pre_fill`** (some
worlds lock dungeon items or boss rewards there), generation will fail loudly,
since the Logic Test can't relocate an item that's already locked. Games that
place only *events* in `pre_fill` (the common case) are unaffected.
