&#13;
## Before Playing&#13;
This randomizer assumes the player is aware of hidden techniques that allow the game to be beaten without items, even at the lowest settings. It is HIGHLY recommended to play through the Basic section of the [Platforming Tricks Tutorial](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1706422414) before starting your first seed!&#13;
&#13;
Additionally, the logic assumes that the player knows of hidden paths throughout the game, revealed with Ribbon, Fire Orb, or Carrot Bombs. A patch is available to expose these paths, alongside other useful features! It can be enabled by setting "Apply Beginner Mod" to `true`.&#13;
&#13;
## What's Changed&#13;

    <content># The Messenger with Universal Tracker integration&#13;
This alternate version of the The Messenger apworld has integration for portal and transition shuffle with [Universal Tracker](https://discord.com/channels/731205301247803413/1367270230635839539).&#13;
&#13;
Compatible with games generated with [Archipelago 0.6.6](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases/tag/0.6.6)&#13;
&#13;
# Installation Instructions (for Windows, but likely compatible with other systems)&#13;
- Install Archipelago (link below) with the generator enabled.&#13;
- Place the new `messenger.apworld` file in your custom world folder.&#13;
- Remove the old `messenger.apworld` file from your `lib/worlds` folder.&#13;
&#13;
# Troubleshooting&#13;
- Make sure you removed your `messenger.apworld` from `lib/worlds` and added the new apworld in `custom_worlds`&#13;
- Report any issue in the [_#messenger_](https://discord.com/channels/731205301247803413/1090822939697500243) channel in the Archipelago discord. Make sure to ping @jouramie otherwise I won't read. &#13;
&#13;
# We Need Your Help! &#13;
If you'd like to help integrate this into the main Archipelago releases, drop us a [code review](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/pull/5344)! :wink:&#13;
Also, please mention in the [_#messenger_](https://discord.com/channels/731205301247803413/1090822939697500243) channel that you used it, and report any issue. This will help with the integration process if some player mention using the beta world! </content>

    <title>Armored Core v0.3.0</title>
    <updated>2026-02-22T22:29:20+00:00</updated>

    <content># v0.3.0 Armored Core (PSX) APworld&#13;
&#13;
## New in this version&#13;
- Starting AC Randomization! With this setting on the AC you generate with at the beginning of the game in the Raven's Test will be random (but still a valid AC).&#13;
- Added a manifest file to make the apworld compatible with future versions of Archipelago.&#13;
&#13;
## Bug Fixes&#13;
- When Shopsanity is off, shop locations are no longer generated for the game. You can now safely play with this option off.&#13;
- When Human+ upgrades are not shuffled into the pool the game no longer fails to generate. You can now safely play with this option off.&#13;
- The Missionsanity Goal Location (Armored Core Goal) now properly has its name associated with itself.&#13;
&#13;
## Known Issues&#13;
- The client is generally a bit sluggish in the menu.&#13;
- The Missions Menu / Shop Menu (when shopsanity is on) sometimes need a moment to structure themselves properly, hover over it for a second before entering or exit and re-enter to get the properly constructed mission selection options. Failing to do so for the Mission Menu can rarely result in a crash.&#13;
- If in the shop a Parts description is completely blank, try hitting Triangle a few more times or moving between entries. This is a Bizhawk issue.&#13;
- When Shopsanity is on, Hidden Parts can be obtained either by someone sending the part to you or picking it up in the level its in. Once the Hidden Part appears in the shop as a check to be sold however, it will no longer appear in its normal level anymore.&#13;
- If you try to start yourself with a part from your pool and you have randomized starting ac on, if you luck into starting with that part your world may fail to generate properly. Try generating again until this doesn't happen. (The same is true for trying to start yourself off with one of the normal starting parts if your starting ac is not randomized).&#13;
- In some cases, selling an equipped optional part will keep it equipped until you open the optional parts menu.&#13;
- It is likely impossible to randomly generate with tank legs to start the game right now.&#13;

    <content>## Fixes  &#13;
 - Mountain Parkway Signature Takedowns logic is fixed.&#13;

&#13;
## Known Issue&#13;
 - In Race Mode (and probably All Mode) the starting car can rarely be replaced by a filler item (Bonus Point), game should still be beatable.&#13;

&#13;
## Game Version&#13;
- You need a PS2 Burnout 3 US ISO (`SLUS-21050`).</content>

&#13;
- **Ap world version:** Unstable 0.3.3&#13;

&#13;
- Fixed same names in Ability Card location strings unintentionally checking off certain Ability Card locations.&#13;

* Stabilized the order in which items and locations are added to the world, eliminating remaining situations where generation is nondeterministic (@Mysteryem}.&#13;
* Update several other aspects of generation to ensure future stability.</content>

    </author>
    <content>- If Bungee Zombie appears in Bobsled Bonanza, Pogo Party or Air Raid, then Umbrella Leaf will be logically expected before the level can be cleared.&#13;
- Giga Gargantuar can no longer appear in Bobsled Bonanza, Pogo Party or Air Raid.&#13;
- Zomboni can no longer appear in Roof: Level 5-5.&#13;
- Conveyor randomisation will no longer allow Spikeweed and Spikerock on Roof levels.&#13;
- Corrected the Sun cost of Spikerock when playing with `easy_upgrade_plants` enabled.&#13;
- Fixed a logic issue that could result in the game expecting you to beat Night levels without Sun producing plants. &#13;
- Fixed the potential for `plant_stat_randomisation` to roll negative Sun costs.&#13;
&#13;
This update only affects the APWorld. There are no changes to the client mod from v1.5.1.&#13;

    <content>**NOTE:** This version has breaking changes! Only use this client and this apworld together. **Previous versions are incompatible with this release!**&#13;
&#13;
### Changelog (0.7.1 -&gt; 0.8.0)&#13;
&#13;
#### Client&#13;
* **Install method change:**&#13;
  * This client **no longer uses ASI Loader** to inject into the game. Going forward this client will be distributed as a zipped collection of `dsound.dll`, `SWR_AP_Client.ini` and `APCpp.dll` which will all need to be placed **in the game's main folder**. Players with previous installations should delete their ASI Loader dll and scripts folder before installing this version.&#13;
* **Save location change**:&#13;
  * Starting this version each slot and seed will create its own save folder (within `ArchipelagoSaves` in the main directory). If you connect and go "where are my saves???", that's why. Your vanilla saves and saves from other seeds will not be visible once everything is connected. They are not being deleted!&#13;
* **New client config file options**:&#13;
  * `waittime`: Adds additional milliseconds before running client code and patching the game. Adjusting this is not advised and should generally not be necessary for most users.&#13;
  * `hidepurchases`: Removes purchased items from Watto's shop to cut down on clutter. When you are purchasing an item it is still replaced with a tiny Watto model, but on subsequent visits that item will not be loaded. Keeping this disabled retains the previous shop behavior.&#13;
* **Pit Droid Shop change**:&#13;
  * There was a bug with previous versions where the pit droid shop didn't do a good job of tracking whether its locations had been sent to the server, and as a result it could become impossible to check some of them in certain cases. This client will track that more closely, and instead of modifying what checks are available to the player, it will simply not charge the player 1000 Truguts if that location was already checked.&#13;
  * This means that in asyncs you will see upon relaunching that you will have 3 checks there again, even if you purchased them. *This isn't ideal and will be addressed in a future update*, but you will only be charged for droid checks the server has not marked as completed already.&#13;
  * Please note you will still need at least 1000 Truguts to perform these checks, even if you aren't actually charged for them.&#13;
* **Faster item processing**:&#13;
  * Backend changes to how items are processed have reduced the need for delays between receiving them.&#13;
* **Crash Logs**:&#13;
  * The client now makes use of a crash logging library to dump some useful information into a folder helpfully called `crash_dumps`.&#13;
&#13;
#### apworld&#13;
* **Changed option: `Course Unlock Mode`**:&#13;
  * New settings are `Full Shuffle`, `Circuits` and `Progressive Circuits`. The circuit modes now both treat the Invitational Circuit just like the others, with the vanilla unlocks option removed. This was done largely to simplify the logic and remove generation errors. With the ongoing client restructure, vanilla unlocks could potentially make a reappearance down the line, but for now they are being shelved. `Full Shuffle` is the default recommended mode now.&#13;
  * Circuit pass modes now retain "Course Unlock" checks and place appropriate "vanilla" items on them to unlock the next course in the circuit. &#13;
    * As an example, completing `Amateur Race 1 - Course Unlock` will award an `Amateur Course Unlock` item. This bypasses the vanilla game unlocking code and brings these modes closer in-line with how `Full Shuffle` works.&#13;
* **Option `Shop Costs` default changed**:&#13;
  * `Normalized` is now the default setting to soften some of the outlier expensive purchases in the shop and reduce grind.&#13;
* .apworld now contains manifest for eventual compatibility with Archipelago 0.7.0 when it releases.&#13;
* Lambda capture issues resolved (special thanks to Mysteryem!)</content>

    <content># Factorio: Space Age apworld v1.0.0&#13;
&#13;
Setup docs here: https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/Archipelago/blob/space-age/worlds/factorio_space_age/docs/setup_en.md&#13;
&#13;
Source code here: https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/Archipelago/tree/space-age/worlds/factorio_space_age&#13;
&#13;
Hello everyone! I've emerged from a 6 week frenzy seeing if I could tackle getting the Space Age expansion into Archipelago. It ended up taking a very different approach from the core Factorio world by Berserker et al.&#13;
&#13;
### Differences from core Factorio&#13;
&#13;
There are numerous necessary changes due to Space Age being kinda a completely different game,&#13;
but some of the notable design choices here that deviate from the core Factorio world are:&#13;
&#13;
* Random recipe generation is removed.&#13;
* Random technology dependency generation is removed.&#13;
* Craftsanity is removed.&#13;
* The vanilla tech tree requirements and shape are preserved. Trigger techs and dependencies are all vanilla, but the effect of each research objective is random.&#13;
* Different groupings of progressive item chains.&#13;
* Infinite technologies are shuffled locally and optionally used as filler items.&#13;
&#13;
There are also a ton of options to check out (template attached with this release).&#13;
&#13;
### Feedback&#13;

    <title>Cobalt Core v1.1.5</title>

    <author>

    </author>
    <content>- `shuffle_artifacts` now has a `double` setting, which is the new default. With this setting, almost all AP artifacts give two AP items instead of one, to compensate for the amount of artifacts to artifact offerings ratio. You can still get one item per artifact with the `simple` setting.&#13;
- AP artifacts now show which items they give and the recipient's names on the button itself.&#13;
- The codex has been revamped.&#13;
  - All cards and artifacts are now unlocked in the codex from the start, with extra visuals to show which ones have been actually unlocked in AP or not&#13;
  - Added the "Archipelago Tracker" page in the codex. It shows you which items you can access, which ones you've gotten, and which ones have been hinted.&#13;
- Added the `auto_release_characters` option (off by default). With it, you can set an amount of run completions required for a character to automatically release all their associated items, so that you never need to run with them again. Be careful though, some of these items may be traps!&#13;
- The mod now checks more accurately for the APworld version when connecting, and should give a more precise error in the log in case of version mismatches in the future.&#13;
- Hovering over character portraits anywhere will now show you the amount of memories (or memory items in case of `shuffle_memories`) that you've found with them in the tooltip, including during a run.&#13;
&#13;
The YAML and APWorld must both be updated.&#13;
&#13;
As always, thanks everyone for the feedback! While there are some more minor features I want to add, I think I'll bundle them with 1.2.0 and the progression smoothing, which means that barring any significant bugs, this should be the last version before 1.2.0.</content>

&#13;
The game client has been completely rewritten from scratch. It runs in the browser now.&#13;
&#13;
The .apworld now has a manifest, but has otherwise not changed since 0.10.3.&#13;
&#13;
# Changes since 0.11.11&#13;
1. Fix an oversight that caused messages to get repeatedly processed over and over again. This was most visible when telling the rat to do something: it would go into an infinite loop of acknowledging the request forever.&#13;
&#13;
Everything from the original native version *should* be present in this one. If not, then that's a bug. Please report it.&#13;
&#13;
# Other changes since 0.10.4&#13;
&#13;
1. You no longer need to run any native executable files. It's a web app now, so just go to that URL.&#13;
   - If you want to self-host it, it's all static files - this release should have a  "dist.zip" asset that you can just drop into any reasonable static web server.&#13;
   - You will **need** to self-host if you want it to work with an Archipelago server that doesn't use HTTPS.&#13;
2. You can now launch directly to the game if you know all the magical things to type into the URL fragment. This is mostly provided so you can refresh the page without having to click through the menu again.&#13;
3. As is web tradition, most errors that happen when the game is running will not automatically take you out of the game screen. Instead, they will just create banners along the top that you have to click to dismiss. Hopefully, this will never happen to you (of course, it happened to me constantly while developing this).&#13;
4. Not only is this a web app (and so it finally runs on Mac and Android), but it's a **progressive** web app. This means that you can "install" it as a native app on Android, even.&#13;
5. Interval between "when STILL blocked" messages is now configurable (though it's still got a minimum of 15 minutes so that you don't spam everyone).&#13;
6. There's now a separate "Connecting..." screen between the settings page and the main game screen, instead of showing a version of the game screen instantly and then modifying it once you're finally connected.&#13;
7. When you get disconnected for any reason (other than clicking the button to go back to the menu), you now get spat back to the same "Connecting..." screen (with a different message) and it will try to reconnect you automatically, at least once every 30 seconds.&#13;
8. The game version is now visible in the title bar and on the game screen. This is more relevant here because browsers like to cache way too much stuff.&#13;
9. Somewhat redesigned the layout of the game screen to be a bit clearer. Instead of shorthand "RAT" / "NOM" / etc., we have a "RATS: ##" expander, and then all the active buffs / debuffs are visible with their full names under it. This takes up a lot of screen space, so you can collapse it to just show the rat count.&#13;
10. The left panel can also shrink MUCH more than before.&#13;
11. The position of the grid separator is now saved between runs.&#13;
12. If your slot has an alias, we now show that (without the parenthetical slot name) instead of always just showing the official slot name.&#13;
13. Chat commands can now be addressed to the rat's alias (with or without the parenthetical slot name) instead of always having to be its slot name, provided that nobody else in the room has picked the same alias.&#13;
14. Added a simple chat tab to just send / receive messages in the room, so that you don't HAVE to flip back and forth. It's not quite as fancy as the standard text client, but it should be good enough.&#13;
15. Elements that you can interact with all support tab-focusing, and the tooltips as well.&#13;
16. When a lot of things happen all at once that the game hasn't animated yet, the app will try to play back everything that happened. This was important when moving to a web app, because browsers don't render things when the tab is in the background or minimized, so when you come back, a LOT of things could have changed. In fact, when LOTS of things changed, it speeds up the playback up to 5x so that you can "catch up" to the current state more quickly.&#13;
17. When clicking on an item in the panel to request a hint, the confirmation box now shows up right next to it instead of in the middle of the screen.&#13;
18. The "u win." screen now just covers a *part* of the map instead of taking you all the way out.&#13;
19. Fix an oversight where the self-host bundle was still expecting to run on `https://autopelago.app`&#13;
20. Add a discriminator to the beginning of the title for the benefit of those with multiple tabs&#13;
21. #129: Bring back the ability to show the path to the target by clicking on the rat.&#13;
22. Fix a minor issue where the rat would face its ultimate target instead of the next location along the route to it.&#13;
23. Fix an issue where the rat would go to the nearest user-requested location instead of going in order of when they were requested.&#13;
24. (After the failed v0.11.2) probably fix a calculation error in the "show path" calculation?&#13;
25. #130: Bring back the ability to personalize your rat.&#13;
26. Replace Pixi.js with native elements, which should unblock those getting the error "`CanvasRenderer` is not yet implemented". This also probably brings with it a mixed bag of performance penalties and performance improvements.&#13;
27. Fix several ways in which the page could look self-inconsistent while the rat is still catching up to where the server is.&#13;
28. Correct the size of the "Personalize Your Rat!" button on the main page for non-Firefox browsers.&#13;
29. Remove a brief flicker of the "Personalize Your Rat!" window's header text. It might still sometimes shift, but generally shouldn't have any frames where the text goes outside the window like it did.&#13;
30. Add tooltips for the filler squares to show their names, exactly the same as tooltips for landmarks.&#13;
31. Add information about known hints onto these tooltips.&#13;
32. Move some quest markers out of the way so that they no longer overlap filler squares.&#13;
33. Shrink landmark images so that they don't crowd their filler squares.&#13;
34. Extra-shrink the hitboxes around the quest markers to make their nearby filler squares easier to get to.&#13;
35. Add the ability to "hyper-focus" a location by clicking on it (or pressing Enter on it if you are tabbing through with your keyboard). This "hyper-focus" can only be adjusted by interacting with it in the browser (no chat commands supported, by design) for multiple reasons.&#13;
36. #134: Fix an issue where the rat's focused location(s) would get cleared — even if the location wasn't checked — if it happened to land on the location without any actions remaining to make an attempt at checking it.&#13;
37. Fix an oversight from 0.11.5 where the animation checkboxes did nothing.&#13;
    - In addition to restoring the original few things that these checkboxes control:&#13;
        1. Transitions on Food/Energy/Luck bars will be animated (or not) according to the player animation checkbox.&#13;
        2. Tile examples in the tooltips and the "u win." dialog will be animated (or not) along with the tiles, synchronized to the same frame.&#13;
        3. The dashed line showing the path from the rat to its target location will be animated (or not) according to the player animation checkbox.&#13;
        4. The rat token will animate its movement from one location to the next (or not) according to the player animation checkbox.&#13;
        5. On systems where the user has indicated a [preference for "reduced motion"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/At-rules/@media/prefers-reduced-motion#user_preferences), the two checkboxes will be unchecked by default.&#13;
38. #143: Stop automatically reconnecting after getting disconnected. This has been resurrecting rooms that had previously timed out, which is rude. Some version of this MAY come back in the future, if I can find a way to detect when it would be OK.&#13;
39. #142: The dashed path to the rat's current target will no longer get misaligned and shrunk on games that don't go all the way to Snakes on a Planet.&#13;
40. #138: The sidebar now has an extra spot at the beginning that shows the number of all rats. This lets you do the same stuff that the other icons in this panel let you do: click to hint for any rat (i.e., any item in the "Rats" item group) and hover over it to see a tooltip with all the hinted rat locations.&#13;
41. Because I kept getting annoyed while testing the previous one, tooltips now stay around when the cursor goes inside them instead of needing the cursor to stay inside the original trigger box. This means that you can now highlight text from these tooltips with your mouse and copy-paste.&#13;
42. I might have fixed a bug where sometimes the rat wouldn't send its chat messages immediately, but would wait for some arbitrary event to happen in the future. I have no idea why I wrote it the way I did at first...&#13;
43. Whenever we see `{RANDOM_PLAYER}` in any message from your YAML file, we'll replace that with the current alias of a random player. I tried to make this as useful and sensible as I could:&#13;
   - If you are the only player (on your team), it will always just pick you. Otherwise, it will never pick you, but instead:&#13;
   - If any other players (on your team) are connected and haven't completed their goal yet, then it will pick a random one of them. Otherwise, it will pick a random other player (on your team).&#13;
   - If there are multiple `{RANDOM_PLAYER}` placeholders in a single message, then we'll try to pick as many **different** players as possible (in random order still), only repeating a player if there are more placeholders than the number of players allowed by the above rules. To be precise, we sample randomly without replacement from the list until the list is empty, then we refill it and repeat the process until all placeholders have been filled.</content>

    <title>Dicey Dungeons v0.2.0b0</title>

    <content>### Dicey Dungeons v0.2.0-beta&#13;
&#13;
Warning: This release comes with many new options. Because of this, multiworlds generated using previous releases will probably not play well with the new client. I HIGHLY recommend waiting to upgrade to this release until all multiworlds generated have been played through.&#13;
&#13;
Changes from v0.1.2.1-beta:&#13;
- Option: Episode progression - Choose between 'vanilla' (like starting a new save file, later episodes are locked until earlier episodes are completed) and 'open_world' (relies on your Dicey Dungeons save, all episodes available from start)&#13;
- Option: Floor 5 Shop Selection - Choose between 'vanilla' (floor 5 shops will have an upgrade, a heal, and an item, which might be a multiworld item) and 'items_only' (floor 5 shops will have 3 items, all of which may be multiworld items)&#13;
- Option: Skip Cutscenes - Choose whether you want intro/outro cutscenes for episodes to be skipped&#13;
- Option: Split dice - Choose if you'd like dice (gained from leveling up) to be locked behind receiving a certain number of Dice Shards first. Configurable both in required numbers of dice shards per die, and number of spare dice shards added to the pool, for safety&#13;
- Flavor: Revamped filler items - There are now multiple filler items, all inspired by fighters in game (e.g. Rotten Apple's Pet Worm)&#13;
- Graphics: A new title screen, featuring an Archipelago logo created using the Characters from the game (inspired by krunk on Discord) will now appear instead of the default title screen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

    <content>**Note that setup instructions have changed slightly in v1.3.0+. Within Duckstation, navigate to Settings &gt; Game Properties &gt; Console and select "Interpreter" under "Execution Mode".**&#13;
&#13;
This release contains both Client (S3AP.Desktop.exe) and APWorld changes.&#13;
&#13;
New Features:&#13;
- Full Bundle Gemsanity&#13;
  - Every gem in the game, except for Super Bonus Round, becomes a location.  Gem bundles of 50 or 100 per level are added to the item pool.&#13;
  - This adds nearly 4000 locations, of which roughly 200 are progression items.  You may wish to modify your filler pool accordingly.&#13;
  - Unless played with other games of a similar size, this is likely to negatively impact placement of the multiworld's progression items and may spam game clients with checks.  As a result, the host must approve use of this setting in their host.yaml file.&#13;
&#13;
Bug Fixes:&#13;
- Fixed a bug where Egg for Sale was not marked as complete in Open World Mode.&#13;
- Fixed a bug where Universal Tracker was showing Sparx levels as being in logic before the previous one was completed in Open World Mode.&#13;
- Partially fixed a bug where Molten Crater and Seashell Shores would not open immediately on receiving enough eggs in Open World Mode with Vanilla Level Locks.&#13;
  - If you receive your 10th or 14th egg while in Sunrise Spring Home, you will still need to exit and re-enter the homeworld to enter these levels.</content>

    <content>- New Feature: MultiplayerVision&#13;
  - Enabled from the config file. Defaults to false, until I'm sure it's stable. Then I'll probably make it default to true afterwards&#13;
  - Allows seeing other Stardew players in game&#13;
  - Uses bounce packets for communication.&#13;
    - Frequent packets for positioning (map, pixel, direction, velocity)&#13;
    - Rare packets for player appearance updates (clothes, hair, etc)&#13;
  - No player limit. If you experience lag, feel free to share how many players caused it&#13;
  - Can only see players currently on the same map as you&#13;
  - Cannot interact with other players, only see them&#13;
  - Most animations will not happen (tools, weapons, sleep). Some animations will play (walk, run)&#13;
  - Works between slots, and also when cooping the same slot&#13;
  - The interval for updates, combined with whatever latency you have with the server, will cause some stuttering and rubber banding. I don't think there's a way to avoid this while keeping network usage low, so we have to live with it.</content>

    <content># Notice&#13;
Keep in mind that this is a beta release and is not currently ready for a full release. Do not bring this into serious groups unless you know what you are doing. This is for testing purposes only to ensure everything is ready when this update gets a full release. Report bugs and check certain things to make sure everything works as intended.&#13;
&#13;
# Changes&#13;
- Updated to require AP v0.6.6 to encourage people to update with security patch.&#13;
- Deathlink! Keep in mind that every area you are able to die in except for Mount Crumpit, Clock Tower, Post Office, &amp; Sleigh Room due to ingame issues I encountered during testing.&#13;
- Gadgets are now given to you sooner! No longer you are required to use the computer to get the gadget. Just reload/enter a new area to get the gadgets on demand!&#13;
- Sleigh Parts are now items in the pool! Find them through out the multiworld and enter the sleigh ride with the Sleigh Room Key! Because of this, the sleigh part locations are temporarily removed for the time being.&#13;
- Grass.&#13;
- Presents are in the pool aswell. These are items that do nothing to the game if you decide to not want to add rotten eggs to the pool.&#13;
- Mission completion for squashing all gifts should be removed if you exclude at least one subarea per area. For example if you have `giftsanity` enabled and you have excluded on of Whoville's subareas, the mission will be removed.&#13;
- Added new `misc_checks` option. Adds various categorized locations in the multiworld. From platforms to killsanity, and other funny locations.&#13;
- Few new item/location groups&#13;
&#13;
# Bug Fixes&#13;
- Fixed bug regarding certain locations sending when they should not be.&#13;
- Elevator in Mount Crumpit should hopefully be positioned in the right level when using the teleport multibind&#13;
- Various small logic tweaks and fixes that went overlooked.&#13;
&#13;
# Things to do until full release&#13;
- Fix Heart of Stone locations sometimes not sending&#13;
- Support for incremental location checks&#13;
- OR condition addresses for locations&#13;
- Fix fuzzer errors&#13;
&#13;
There are probably many more changes I missed. Look around and see what you can spot!</content>

    <content>## TL;DR&#13;
&#13;
The main highlight are rules based on upgrade connections to help prevent a lot of upgrades being "reachable" in Sphere 0/1 in UT.&#13;
&#13;
### Changed&#13;
&#13;
* Added save file functionality.&#13;
    * Connecting to a server will check for save files in `user://` with the same seed and player.&#13;
    * Saving will occur more frequently.&#13;
* Added additional rules for node connections.&#13;
* Added additional rules to seperate easy milestones from milestones that logically need to be grinded.&#13;
* Set item classification of `Progressive SpawnRate` from `useful` to `progressive`.&#13;
* Disabled auto-unlocking upgrade locations, as save files properly save per slot.&#13;
&#13;
### Fixes&#13;
&#13;
* Save created UUID to file in `user://` and load UUID from said file, ensuring UUIDs are reused for future server locking feature.&#13;
&#13;
## What's Changed&#13;
* Validation: Set Upgrade Nodes to checked "continuous" max level by @josephwhite in https://github.com/josephwhite/Emerlads-Nodebuster_AP_Mod/pull/38&#13;
* UUID and Save Files in User Folder by @josephwhite in https://github.com/josephwhite/Emerlads-Nodebuster_AP_Mod/pull/45&#13;

    <title>UNBEATABLE Arcade v0.2.1a0</title>
    <updated>2026-02-27T06:47:59+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>AllPoland</name>
    </author>
    <content>This update comes with a fix to generation issues, as well as some much needed QOL features!&#13;
&#13;
APworld changes:&#13;
- Fixed generation errors where location count did not match item count (thanks to [@gerbiljames](https://github.com/gerbiljames))&#13;
- Added a song blacklist option - add any songs you *don't* want to include in the randomizer here. Useful if you don't want to play bookend for 30 minutes or a friend's apworld is too weak to handle Clef's greatness&#13;
&#13;
Client changes:&#13;
- Added more configuration for death link - you can now separately choose whether or not to trigger deathlink on restarting/quitting a song (thanks to @estradiol-valerate)&#13;
- Added a notification popup for sending/receiving items (also thanks to @estradiol-valerate)&#13;
  - Notification popups can also be configured in the mod settings!&#13;
&#13;
This release is **compatible** with v0.2.0!&#13;
&#13;
Check [the README](https://github.com/AllPoland/unbeatAP/blob/main/README.md) for installation instructions.&#13;
&#13;
The mod and apworld are both still early in development, and are not feature complete nor are there guarantees about stability.&#13;
&#13;
**Please read the YAML options carefully and test your options before joining a lobby**, since the pacing and difficulty of the apworld is very volatile. It's currently very easy to make a randomizer that is way too short or way too long.&#13;
&#13;
Any feedback or ideas are welcome in the "UNBEATABLE (PC)" thread in `#future-game-design` in the [Archipelago Discord](https://discord.gg/8Z65BR2)!</content>
