(`data_cubes_required`)\r\n    - You can have anywhere from 1 to 200 data cubes total in your game (`data_cubes_total`), or...\r\n    - ... you can specify the number of data cubes that should be present, as a percentage of the required amount. (`data_cubes_total_percent`)\r\n  - Logic: Boss Time-out (`logic_boss_timeout`)\r\n    - This used to be controlled by Logic Difficulty, but it has been split out into its own option.\r\n    - If true, timing out bosses that can be timed out is expected of the player in logic.\r\n  - Local Level Percentage (`local_level_percent`)\r\n    - Sets some percentage of randomly chosen levels to be local to your own world.\r\n    - May reduce the likelihood of BK mode due to not being sent any levels, but may also result in less interaction with other worlds. \r\n\r\n### Minor changes\r\n- Bug fixes:\r\n  - Fixed a crash when firing a Flying Punch\r\n  - Fixed Easy difficulty getting 175% enemy health instead of the intended, vanilla 75%\r\n  - Fixed player names with aliases getting cut off in the shop\r\n  - Fixed AP items hiding behind destroyed ground enemies sometimes\r\n  - Fixed two locations in SAVARA II (Episode 1) accidentally being swapped with each other\r\n- You can now paste (CTRL+V) into input fields like the chat box and server name\r\n- Sidekicks that use ammo now have their ammo amounts displayed in the upgrade menu\r\n- Expert logic difficulty plays a little nicer early on than it used to\r\n",

      "description": "Welcome to 1.0, Archipelago Tyrian.\r\n\r\nWith this release, I consider Tyrian as an APWorld to be in **beta**. Every single level in the game is now playable, and the vast majority of things that were on my to-do list are now present, including some stuff that was sorely needed; for example, the ability to re-map inputs while in game.\r\n\r\nDue to the great number of changes made between this version and the last stable version (v0.80.2), v1.0.0 is _not compatible_ with games generated for a prior version.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\nMajor changes:\r\n- Episodes 4 and 5 now have logic, item placements, etc. This means that the entire game can now be randomized.\r\n- Keyboard and joystick inputs can now be configured in-game.\r\n- Improved joystick controls in general, especially for menu navigation.\r\n- Connecting to a server with a password is now supported.\r\n- The Jukebox can now be accessed in the middle of a game, and now displays messages from Archipelago while in it.\r\n- The three bonus games (Zinglon's Ale, Zinglon's Squadrons, and Zinglon's Revenge) can now be played; they do not unlock anything or send any items, but they can serve as a way to pass the time in BK mode.\r\n  - Optionally, access to these bonus games can be locked behind items in the multiworld.\r\n- Levels can now be removed from the item pool, which automatically removes their locations too; consider this a more advanced method of excluding a level that you don't want to play.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Minor changes / added polish:</summary>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Archipelago Radar is no longer an option at generation time, and can instead be toggled in the options menu in-game.\r\n<li>All options have been organized into groups.\r\n<li>Maximum power level is now shown in the weapon select / upgrade menu, as locks over the power bar.\r\n<li>Archipelago's \"race mode\" is now supported. (Cheats are disabled if race mode is on)\r\n<li>Websocket compression is now supported, removing a warning from Archipelago version 0.6.0 onward.\r\n<li>Tyrian 2000's weapons now use consistent (and no longer ear-piercing) sound effects.\r\n<li>The planet display when choosing the next level to play and/or shop at now smoothly moves to the planet the level is at, instead of instantly snapping there.\r\n<li>Post-game results screen improvements:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The number of times you exit the level early (via quitting from the menu, without dying) is now tracked and displayed.\r\n<li>Time does not start being tracked until a level is entered for the first time. This makes the times displayed a more accurate representation of how long the game was played, ignoring setup time.\r\n<li>Locally collected checks are now tracked and distinguished separately from same slot co-op / collected checks.\r\n<li>As a result of the above change, games with auto-release turned on now properly show the number of checks that you made; previously, they would always show full completion.\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Bug fixes:</summary>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Updated to the latest version of OpenTyrian, fixing a few bugs that were present upstream.\r\n<li>Fixed a vanilla bug where player shots could have their damage underflow if destroying multiple enemies at the same time.\r\n<li>Fixed items in the shop with underscores in their names sometimes not showing up properly.\r\n<li>DeathLink:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Fixed the string clean-up / unicode character parsing code not being run on DeathLink messages. Unicode characters in them that exist in Tyrian's font (e.g., \"\u00e9\") should now display in game.\r\n<li>Empty DeathLink messages are now treated properly, and a more generic message will be displayed instead.\r\n</ul>\r\n<li>Error messages that show up while connecting to a server are now properly contained in the message box, instead of being allowed to run outside of the bounds of the screen.\r\n<li>Fixed patched level events sometimes containing stale data. This manifested in a lot of random, difficult to reproduce bugs that changed depending on what order levels were played in.\r\n<li>Fixed the generic item names in Shop Mode: Hidden not showing up correctly.\r\n</ul>\r\n</details>",
