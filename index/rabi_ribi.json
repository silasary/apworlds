Open **rabi_ribi.apworld** with Archipelago Launcher; it will be automatically installed to Archipelago's `custom_world` folder.\r\n\r\n## To Generate a Game\r\n1. Download **Rabi-Ribi.yaml** below.\r\n2. Edit the file to have your desired settings.\r\n3. Navigate to your Archipelago installation (by default, `C:\\ProgramData\\Archipelago`).\r\n4. Navigate to the `Players` folder under your Archipelago base folder.\r\n5. Move **Rabi-Ribi.yaml** into this folder (you can rename it if you wish).\r\n6. Open the Archipelago Launcher and click the **Generate** button.\r\n7. Your generated game will be in the `Output` folder in the Archipelago base folder.\r\n\r\n## To Host a Game\r\n1. Navigate to the [Host Game](https://archipelago.gg/uploads) page.\r\n2. Upload the `.zip` file outputted from the above \"To Generate a Game\"\r\n\r\n## To Start Playing\r\n1. Make sure you have an Archipelago room from the previous \"To Host a Game\".\r\n2. Open the Archipelago Launcher and click \"Rabi-Ribi Client\".\r\n3. Connect to the room via the room URL and port.\r\n4. (First Time) When prompted, select the **Rabi-Ribi Installation Folder** on Steam. (This can be changed later via the `host.yaml` file in your Archipelago base folder)\r\n5. (First Time, Optional) When prompted, select the **Rabi-Ribi Poptracker Pack** `.zip` file, available [here](https://github.com/rajanb/RabiRibiPoptracker). (This can be changed later via the `host.yaml` file in your Archipelago base folder)\r\n6. Launch Rabi-Ribi through Steam.\r\n7. On the Rabi-Ribi main menu, press F5 and select the scenario listed in the Rabi-Ribi Client.\r\n8. Start and have fun!\r\n\r\n## Using Universal Tracker\r\nUniversal Tracker is fully supported in the Rabi-Ribi APWorld! This includes support for providing an external poptracker pack to enable a Map Tracker tab. You can get the latest poptracker pack [here](https://github.com/rajanb/RabiRibiPoptracker). If you are running Archipelago 0.6.2 or higher, the Map Tracker will also support showing your current location, represented by an Erina Badge.\r\n\r\nNote: If you have used a previous version of the Rabi-Ribi APWorld, you may need to edit your `host.yaml` to set the location of the pack, with `ut_pack_path` under `rabi_ribi_options`.\r\n\r\n## Other Notes\r\nAt this time, the only goal this randomizer supports is \"Easter Egg Hunt\", which are all local! The goal is NOT to complete the base game (although there is intention to add this later).\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Bandaid fix for failed world generation when using include_post_game = true and include_warp_destination = false by @Peblo0110 in https://github.com/tdkollins/Archipelago-Rabi-Ribi/pull/51\r\n* Fix deathlink sending extra death at high health by @DavidBarringer in https://github.com/tdkollins/Archipelago-Rabi-Ribi/pull/50\r\n* Bug fixes by @Peblo0110 in https://github.com/tdkollins/Archipelago-Rabi-Ribi/pull/55\r\n* Additional Bug Fixes by @dclaganiere in https://github.com/tdkollins/Archipelago-Rabi-Ribi/pull/53\r\n* Fix Goal Sending Multiple Times by @dclaganiere in https://github.com/tdkollins/Archipelago-Rabi-Ribi/pull/60\r\n* Modify logic to respect darkness (Thank you kingdragonite) by @Peblo0110 in https://github.com/tdkollins/Archipelago-Rabi-Ribi/pull/57\r\n* Implementation of cross map check by @Peblo0110 in https://github.com/tdkollins/Archipelago-Rabi-Ribi/pull/61\r\n* Fix Several Logic Errors by @dclaganiere in https://github.com/tdkollins/Archipelago-Rabi-Ribi/pull/63\r\n* Fix common map issues and update starting warp area by @dclaganiere in https://github.com/tdkollins/Archipelago-Rabi-Ribi/pull/64\r\n* Update Client UT Implementation by @dclaganiere in https://github.com/tdkollins/Archipelago-Rabi-Ribi/pull/65\r\n* Add workflow to create APWorld by @dclaganiere in https://github.com/tdkollins/Archipelago-Rabi-Ribi/pull/66\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @Peblo0110 made their first contribution in https://github.com/tdkollins/Archipelago-Rabi-Ribi/pull/51\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/tdkollins/Archipelago-Rabi-Ribi/compare/beta-1.3.2...beta-1.4.0",

It is HIGHLY recommended to play through the Basic section of the [Platforming Tricks Tutorial](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1706422414) before starting your first seed!\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the logic assumes that the player knows of hidden paths throughout the game, revealed with Ribbon, Fire Orb, or Carrot Bombs. A patch is available to expose these paths, alongside other useful features! It can be enabled by setting \"Apply Beginner Mod\" to `true`.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Fixes for Issues Found in Post-Game Testing by @dclaganiere in https://github.com/tdkollins/Archipelago-Rabi-Ribi/pull/68\r\n* Removed unused functions. by @dclaganiere in https://github.com/tdkollins/Archipelago-Rabi-Ribi/pull/69\r\n* Move Beta Setup Instructions to Git by @dclaganiere in https://github.com/tdkollins/Archipelago-Rabi-Ribi/pull/72\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/tdkollins/Archipelago-Rabi-Ribi/compare/beta-1.4.0...beta-1.4.1",
