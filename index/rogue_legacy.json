Basically did most of a rewrite of the Archipelago client code logic, and that seemed to have fixed it. Let me know if you run into these bugs!\r\n\r\n## Known Bugs (Planned to be fixed in next Alpha)\r\n\r\n- Carnival Dagger minigame does not reward gold or an item, even if you destroy all targets.\r\n- The Item Received list currently obstructs the Fountain Piece UI element.\r\n- Teleporting to starting room does not place player on teleporter pad.\r\n- After defeating a boss, camera will center on diary instead of fountain door.\r\n    - Player can also interact with diary due to this.\r\n- Herodotus and Ponce de Leon are smaller than they should be.\r\n- Maximum manor skills do not reset properly when loading a save, going to main menu, then loading a different save.\r\n- Game does not handle losing connection to Archipelago server gracefully and may crash on any subsequent attempt to communicate with the Archipelago server.\r\n- Installer does not verify if vanilla RL directory was selected correctly.\r\n- Red border does not appear around found blueprints or runes in a category you do not have unlocked.\r\n    - Still will not allow player to purchase or equip them without relevant upgrade.\r\n- Toggling DeathLink in the menu and re-opening the menu will show the default DeathLink status.\r\n    - This is purely a visual bug, as your DeathLink status does actually update.\r\n- Some traits given by \"Genetic Lottery\" do not apply the actual effect.\r\n- Retiring outside the castle after using Architect will softlock your save.\r\n    - ***So, don't do that!***\r\n\r\nIf you run into additional bugs not listed above, please reach out to me on Discord (@thephar).\r\n\r\n## Not Implemented Yet (But planned for next Alpha)\r\n\r\n- In-game chat/text-client is currently disabled pending a complete rewrite.\r\n- On world version 2, shrines and spending upgrades are not obtainable.\r\n- Gold is not magnetically attracted to the player.\r\n- Random Teleport trap does not currently function.\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/ThePhar/RogueLegacyRandomizer/compare/main...1.0.0-alpha5",
