I've emerged from a 6 week frenzy seeing if I could tackle getting the Space Age expansion into Archipelago. It ended up taking a very different approach from the core Factorio world by Berserker et al.\r\n\r\n### Differences from core Factorio\r\n\r\nThere are numerous necessary changes due to Space Age being kinda a completely different game,\r\nbut some of the notable design choices here that deviate from the core Factorio world are:\r\n\r\n* Random recipe generation is removed.\r\n* Random technology dependency generation is removed.\r\n* Craftsanity is removed.\r\n* The vanilla tech tree requirements and shape are preserved. Trigger techs and dependencies are all vanilla, but the effect of each research objective is random.\r\n* Different groupings of progressive item chains.\r\n* Infinite technologies are shuffled locally and optionally used as filler items.\r\n\r\nThere are also a ton of options to check out (template attached with this release).\r\n\r\n### Feedback\r\n\r\nPlease report bugs, feature requests, etc. here: https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/Archipelago/issues\r\n\r\n(I am not very active on Discord.)\r\n",
