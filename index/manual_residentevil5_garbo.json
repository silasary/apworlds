  "description": "Manual games allow you to set custom check locations and custom item names that will be rolled into a multiworld.\nThis allows any variety of game -- PC, console, board games, Microsoft Word memes... really anything -- to be part of a multiworld randomizer.\nThe key component to including these games is some level of manual restriction. Since the items are not actually withheld from the player,\nthe player must manually refrain from using these gathered items until the tracker shows that they have been acquired or sent.",

      "description": "- Updated to Manual Stable (20250813)\r\n- Fixed a logic issue where many locations after the 2-1 Port were not expecting the port key item to access. This affects the following\r\n  - `2-1 BSAA_Emblem_Port_After_Boat`\r\n  - `2-1 BSAA_Emblem_Assist_Jump`\r\n  - `2-1 Guard's Key`\r\n- Fixed a logic issue where `6-1 BSAA_Emblem_Shelf` and `6-1 Pickup Jailbreaker` wasn't requiring the `Crane Keycard` to access, which was required to get to that area of the level.",
