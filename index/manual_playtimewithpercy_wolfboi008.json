  "description": "Manual games allow you to set custom check locations and custom item names that will be rolled into a multiworld.\nThis allows any variety of game -- PC, console, board games, Microsoft Word memes... really anything -- to be part of a multiworld randomizer.\nThe key component to including these games is some level of manual restriction. Since the items are not actually withheld from the player,\nthe player must manually refrain from using these gathered items until the tracker shows that they have been acquired or sent.",

      "description": "# Known Issues\r\n- #2 `Not Enough Locations for Items if Goal is Percy's Best Friend or Parasitic Pals with All Options Disabled`. I need to add more to the Manual that isn't tied to Options to likely fix this, and I'm still trying to think of what else could be added in order to fix this problem without making the Manual feel too...clunky, I guess, is the word? Until this is fixed, I'd be careful about what options you turn on.\r\n  - Friday Morning Goal may fail in some conditions too, but I haven't tested this yet. Like I said, be careful until this issue is fully resolved.\r\n# Changelog\r\n- **Added Jumpscaresanity**.\r\n- Added an Option that lets you remove the Custom Hour Challenges.\r\n- **Added code that removes the Custom Hour Characters as Items if the following conditions are met:**\r\n  - Friday Morning is your Goal.\r\n  - Custom Hour Challenges is disabled.\r\n  - Jumpscaresanity is disabled.\r\n- Added a couple traps. :P",

      "description": "# Known Issues\r\n- Jumpscaresanity is still defaulted to enabled. Whoops. Just a minor issue though, so I'll probably fix that in another hotfix later.\r\n- The `Survive a Night with Tat/Tot Active` Checks don't specify that they mean the Playful Poodle versions. The Poodle Pals are all properly specified, but those two were missed for the Playful Poodles trio. Will probably also hotfix this later.\r\n- The `Custom Hour Checks` Category isn't hidden in the Manual Client when it's intended to be. Also a hotfix issue.\r\n- Logic for Jumpscaresanity Checks doesn't consider the Campaign as a way to get the Checks. Will probably be a minor update later.\r\n# Changelog\r\n- **Added Checks for surviving Nights with the different characters active.**\r\n- Added an extra Check for reaching the halfway point in each of the minigames (except for Friday's, for obvious reasons).\r\n- Added an extra Check for each completed Charge on Friday Morning.\r\n\r\nThese were all required for me to add to finally add enough Checks to make #1 no longer occur. Now, regardless of the Player's YAML settings, the game should generate without any problems.\r\n\r\n- Added more kinds of Traps. ;)\r\n\r\n- Hotfix 1: Got rid of the note about possible generation failures on the Jumpscaresanity Option, as it's no longer necessary.",
