You have a couple of new options in the yaml, but they'll only apply to Castle Sansa; the logic for the rest of the game is the same as before.\r\n  - New option: Logic Level. Higher levels require more tricks and more precise jumps. \"Hard\" is closest to the previous logic.\r\n  - New option: Obscure Tricks. Enable paths and knowledge that aren't commonly known. Always enabled on Expert and Lunatic.\r\n- If you encounter any mistakes in the logic or have any feedback, please don't hesitate to let me know by [opening an issue here](https://github.com/pseudoregalia-modding/pseudoregalia-archipelago/issues/new) or by [joining the Pseudoregalia thread in the Archipelago Discord server](https://discord.com/channels/731205301247803413/1147564210436452393).\r\n\r\n## Other Changes\r\n- New option: Death Link. Have fun.\r\n- You can now toggle Solar Wind once you've obtained it by pressing the top face button on your controller (like Y or triangle), or left ctrl if you're on keyboard.\r\n- You can now hint a random major key with simply `!hint major key` (Thanks Silent).\r\n- \"Attempting to connect\" and \"Connection refused\" messages are now plain text instead of popups.\r\n- The mice are still here but have overcome their shyness a bit.\r\n- Major refactoring under the hood - hopefully you won't notice though!\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Fixed a couple of minor memory leaks.\r\n- Consumed small keys will no longer be restored on scene transition (Thanks spuds).\r\n- Logic now *actually* requires all small keys instead of just 6.\r\n- The save point in the back of Listless Library has been removed to prevent softlocks.",

      "description": "# The Map Patch Update\r\n\r\n## APWorld\r\n\r\n* Map patch support\r\n  * Added the `Castle Sansa - Memento` location and `Memento` item. Also added a `start_with_map` option that places Memento in your starting inventory if turned on.\r\n  * Added time trials as locations and the new outfits as items. To make the time trial item spawn, you need to beat the bronze time (the default goal time shown when first starting the time trial).\r\n  * Added a `randomize_time_trials` option so that the time trials are opt-in. If turned on, the outfits are also randomized. If turned off, the time trials do not have items and the outfits are instead added to your starting inventory.\r\n  * Logic now considers geometry changes and nerfed slide ultras introduced in this version. Geometry changes relevant to logic include the reworked geometry near the entrance to the Tower and the hidden path into the Strong Eyes area of Dungeon.\r\n* Along with support for map patch, this update maintains support for the full gold version. Use the `game_version` option to specify which version you will play. The logic, locations, and items used in generation depend on this option.\r\n* You now spawn in Castle instead of Dungeon when loading into a new save. This was done to give you more sphere 1 checks, to allow shuffling Dream Breaker, and to make it so the trek through the Dungeon dark rooms is no longer required to access the rest of the game.\r\n* Dream Breaker is now shuffled instead of being locked to its vanilla location. However, you can turn on the `start_with_breaker` option to start the game with it instead.\r\n* Other logic changes\r\n  * Since going from Dungeon to Underbelly is no longer required at the beginning of the game, entering the Dungeon dark rooms from the breakable wall in Dungeon is now considered obscure. However, if you aren't playing with obscure logic, you might still be expected to go into or through the area from Theatre or Underbelly.\r\n  * Navigating the Dungeon dark rooms now requires nothing on expert+, meaning you might be expected to go through them without light. Similarly, throwing Dream Breaker for light is now considered obscure, so the only non-obscure thing the logic will expect for entering the area is having Ascendant Light.\r\n  * Some Underbelly logic cleanup.\r\n\r\n## Client/Mod\r\n\r\n* Added compatibility with the new locations and items.\r\n* When you connect to the server, the mod checks the version you are playing on and compares it against the `game_version` option and warns you if they don't match.\r\n* `The Underbelly - Surrounded By Holes` spawns correctly on both versions.\r\n* You can now save by touching a save point before you've received Dream Breaker (since you're no longer guaranteed to have Dream Breaker before getting to a save point).\r\n* Added an integration with the PopTracker pack that can switch the zone map automatically when you go through a zone transition. (This will only happen if the `Auto Swap Map` setting is turned on in the pack.)\r\n\r\n# Short Version\r\n\r\n* Map patch fully supported, with time trials, new outfits, and the map\r\n* Full gold version still supported: specify version using the `game_version` option\r\n* `The Underbelly - Surrounded By Holes` spawns correctly on both versions.\r\n* Spawn in Castle instead of Dungeon\r\n* Shuffle Dream Breaker\r\n* New options: `start_with_breaker`, `start_with_map`, `randomize_time_trials`\r\n* Logic updates\r\n",

      "description": "Changes:\r\n* Added `split_cling_gem` option, which replaces the Cling Gem item with 3 Cling Shard items, each adding 2 to your wall run limit when obtained\r\n    * When the option is turned on, there are also 2 extra checks in Tower Remains (to account for the extra items)\r\n    * Updated the logic to consider fewer clings when evaluating rules\r\n* The apworld now uses some 0.6.2 exclusive features, so generating will fail unless you upgrade to 0.6.2\r\n\r\nThanks again to @highrow623 for the updates (and release notes lol)",

Previously it was possible to input server commands with `/` (e.g. `/hint`) but now server commands must use `!`.\r\n* Removed the `/disconnect` command. To disconnect, return to the main menu.",

      "description": "Changes: \r\n* Various logic updates (for full details reference the PR #31)\r\n* Added a `major_key_hints` option:\r\n  * If turned on, the text on the tombstones next to the Great Door will tell you where your Major Keys are located.\r\n  * When you read the tombstones, the client will attempt to create hints:\r\n    * If the server is version 0.6.3 or later, hints will always be created.\r\n    * Otherwise, hints will be created only for the keys that are in your world. For keys in other players' worlds, the hint text will be printed to the console so you can copy it.\r\n* Made a small optimization if death link is turned on that sets the `DeathLink` tag on Connect instead of waiting until Connected to update the tags.\r\n* Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when executing the `/connect` command during an active connection (for example, when trying to connect again after inputting incorrect connect information)",
