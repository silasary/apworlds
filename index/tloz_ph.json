This will make any flag stuff easy to implement.\r\n- Added detection for what save file you're playing on, so it doesn't read savedata from the wrong file.\r\n\r\n# Bugfixes\r\n- Linebeck now releases you from TotOK\r\n- Eddo's workshop now works correctly\r\n- Guy with maize colored tunic on Mercay no longer randomly disappears\r\n- Treasure maps dug from the ground or given by an npc now work with the treasure map in your inventory\r\n- Fixed some faulty check hitboxes\r\n- Traveling from sea to land now sets stage flags correctly\r\n- Probably more but I haven't documented properly\r\n\r\n# Known Issues\r\n- Sword and items menu don't appear without a save and quit\r\n- Saving and quitting in some rooms doesn't load it's checks properly, fixed by reentering the room\r\n- Some checks can be lost forever and don't have their backup savedata reads yet. Most notably the big red rupee from the bonk tree on Cannon Island that can fall in the water.\r\n- Reconnecting the bizhawk client in TotOK sometimes gives you more keys\r\n- Courage Crest room on TotOK B6 needs more testing with different item and flag configurations.\r\n- Although spirit island is in logic, Spirit gems are still marked as filler items and progression won't generate there. There are also barely enough spirit gems in the pool.\r\n- There are check conflicts in a couple of rooms with items that can be moved with boomerang or grapple. Will work fine as long as they aren't moved\r\n\r\n# Coming soon:\r\n- Actual good documentation, FAQ and detailed crediting\r\n- Treasure and rupee logic, and shop rando options. Potential shop rotating?\r\n- 2nd half of TotOK\r\n- NW quadrant (and the rest of the game eventually~)\r\n- US version support???\r\n- Hash verification for savefile to slot\r\n- Resources for obscure tricks",

You can safely buy them from shops.\r\n- Phantom chests in TotOK can be farmed for rupees\r\n  - Phantom chests that give ship parts give treasure instead\r\n- Minigames that reward treasure can be farmed for rupees\r\n- Removed treasure maps, these will be added again with salvagesanity\r\n- Started writing an faq in the docs folder of the world [here](https://github.com/carrotinator/Archipelago/blob/a7bff1f0d688dac7b889877acd37bd8b2d548a63/worlds/tloz_ph/docs/faq_and_credits.md)\r\n\r\n## New Yaml Settings\r\n- exclude non-required dungeons\r\n- toggle ghost ship in dungeon pool\r\n- toggle totok in dungeon pool (can't become barren though)\r\n- randomize harrow island (and allow harrow to be a farmable source of rupees)\r\n- randomize masked beedle (may require editing time of day)\r\n- required dungeon hints\r\n- shop hints\r\n- spirit upgrade hints\r\n- fog settings\r\n  - no fog\r\n  - vanilla for - fog disappears after saving tetra\r\n  - open ghost ship - you can find the ghost ship without having the spirits\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes\r\n- Fixed bug where items gotten through memory reads removed the vanilla item from that location\r\n- Fixed a bunch of logic issues in the second half of TotOK\r\n- Killing the rat for a key in Mountain Passage with a pot from the previous floor is now in medium logic\r\n- Fixed a bunch of inconsistent flags\r\n- Fixed some saveram issues\r\n\r\n## Known issues\r\n- You need to save and quit for sword, regal necklace and item menu to function properly\r\n- Exiting the fog towards the rest of the NW quadrant with spirits out and fog removed crashes. Entering the ghost ship removes the spirits and lets you leave safely. Travel through the fog without all spirits functions as normal.\r\n- Reentering the spirit pool on Spirit Island can give you extra spirits\r\n\r\n## Missing Locations\r\n- Salvage and treasure maps don't exist (excluding courage crest)\r\n- Fishing is not implemented\r\n- Post is not implemented. You will never get mail.\r\n- Potions are not implemented in pool, but you can buy them from shops\r\n- Jolene does not exist\r\n- Zauz gives the phantom blade check immedietly. Eventually I'll make him give it based on having a certain amount of rare metals, similar to the old man in oracle of seasons\r\n- The girl on Molida island does not give a treasure map\r\n- Oshus' Spirit gem is a bit inconsistent, but should trigger after Temple of Wind\r\n- Only sensitive locations have backup savefile reads in case they trigger incorrectly or you get them while the client is disconnected.",
