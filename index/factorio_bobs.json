This logic does also account for ALL recursive loops so if a loop is the best way to get an item that will be the logic.\r\nUnfortunately, this has removed the possibility making a pack without a clone of the repository but properly made packs should work with just the apworld (It has also removed the amount of manual work required to make a pack so I can actually make a guide)\r\nIt has also made it impossible to put best logic into the factoriopedia but I have replaced it with the item name required to get each recipe.\r\nI've already I identified a number of deficiencies with this version (like missing recipe types) but it should work despite them and if I continued removing them there would be no end in sight. However, will start making a list and have started a todo.md file if people want to help.\r\n\r\nI've also added in an example of a pack for baketorio\r\n\r\n# Changelog\r\n- New logic: \u201cBest\u201d\r\n- Fixed loading of internal worlds so it actually functions properly as an ap world\r\n- Much less manual work to get a pack working\r\n\t- I can actually make a guide for this version\r\n- Support for fluid pump and generators\r\n- Logical unlocks for items in factoriopedia has be removed due to being incompatible with best logic\r\n- Unlock (ap) items has been added to recipes in factoriopedia\r\n- Just general clean up that should help support future development\r\n\t- I feel like I\u2019ve done a lot more this version but I guess it was mostly just learning LP and restructuring for the new logic\r\n\r\n# Known Issues\r\n- missing recipe types:\r\n\t- boilers (current work around is a custom recipe for steam)\r\n\t- rocket silo\r\n\t- autogenerate break results (trees ect. Current workaround is custom recipes)\r\n\t- spoilage\r\n\t- energy creation and sinks\r\n- ability to remove recipes\r\n\t- only recipes that are named correctly are overridden\r\n- support for unlocking surfaces (no space in space age/exploration)\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/Osiris32-and-a-half/BobFactorioAP/compare/V2.0.0...V2.1.0",
