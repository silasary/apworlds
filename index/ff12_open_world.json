In your Archipelago installation, add the ff12_open_world.apworld to the `custom_worlds` folder\r\n2. Run the Archipelago Launcher (ArchipelagoLauncher.exe)\r\n3. Click `Generate Template Options` to open the folder with the template yaml files\r\n4. Copy the `Final Fantasy 12 Open World.yaml` template to the `Players` folder\r\n5. Open your YAML file and edit the `name: Player{number}` to set your name.\r\n`{number}` is needed if there will others in the seed with a similar name, you can remove it otherwise.\r\n6. Modify any other options you want further below in the YAML.\r\nBy default, locations are very limited for where progression/useful items can appear. Turn on any `include` options you want.\r\n8. If hosting: Run the Archipelago Launcher (ArchipelagoLauncher.exe)\r\n9. Click `Generate`\r\n10. Go the `output` folder, and you will find your created `AP_#####.zip` file.\r\n11. Open the `AP_#####.zip` file and copy out the player .json file with your name on it to somewhere you can find it (Ex: Copy it to your Desktop)\r\nEx: Player1 will need to grab `AP_#####_P1_Player1.json`\r\n12. If you are hosting the game, take the  `AP_#####.zip` and upload it to: https://archipelago.gg/uploads\r\n\r\n### Randomizer Seed Setup\r\n\r\n1. Extract `FF12Randomizer#.#.#.#.7z` (using Windows, 7zip, etc)\r\n2. Open the extracted folder and run FF12Rando.exe\r\nIt may take a while at first launch.\r\n3. On the `1.

Setup` page, click `Load from JSON` and select your player .json file from step 11 above\r\nAfter you do this, the randomizer should switch to 'Archipelago Mode'\r\n5. On the `2. Flags` page, select any additional settings\r\n6. On the `4. Finish` page, click `Generate Seed`\r\n\r\n### AP FF12 Open World Client\r\n\r\n1. Launch the game in **ENGLISH** (Only language supported)\r\n2. Run the Archipelago Launcher (ArchipelagoLauncher.exe)\r\n3. Click `FF12 Open World Client`\r\n4. Connect to your room with the correct port and player name\r\n\r\n**WARNING:** Loading any other saves while connected to the client may send some unexpected checks to the server.
