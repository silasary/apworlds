      "description": "# Version 2.0.0 of Yet Another YARG Archipelago \r\n## **This is an alpha! Minimally tested and likely very buggy!**\r\n\r\n### Major Changes\r\n- **Dynamic location and item names**: Locations and items now use the actual names of your custom songs in-game for all players to see. This is achieved by reading each player's YAML when Archipelago loads and dynamically creating locations based on every player's song list.\r\n- **No more client**: Everything now happens completely inside YARG.\r\n  - All settings are now defined in the YAML, including song pools, song plando and the list of songs to use in your seed.\r\n  - It is **Highly** recommended use the **YARG YAML Creator** to generate your YAML. It is required at minimum to generate your song list.\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n- **Instrument Randomizer**: Each instrument you define in at least one of your pools will be scattered across the multiworld. You must collect the instrument item to play songs from pools requiring that instrument. You will always start with one instrument.\r\n- **Combined goal criteria**: Instead of choosing between \"Collect X fame points\" OR \"Complete X percent of your songs,\" you can now require both, either individually, or neither.\r\n- **New goal condition**: In addition to previous goal conditions, you can now require finding your individual goal song unlock item in the pool.\r\n- **New YAML Creator**: A standalone program for creating your YAML file. This is **required** as it is the only way to fill in the hash string or obtain the Song Export file needed for the \"Song List\" option.",

      "description": "## Yet Another YARG AP V2.4.0\r\n### APWorld Changes\r\n- New Song Pool settings: `Min Time` and `Max Time`. Lets you define the minimum and maximum song length (in seconds) allowed in the pool.\r\n- New setting: `Song Pack Percentage`. Choose what percentage of songs unlock as part of a song pack instead of the previous all-or-nothing behavior.\r\n- New setting: `Extra Song Unlock Percentage`. Adds a second copy of a percentage of your song unlock items to the pool.\r\n- New *experimental* setting `Max Setlist Time`: Limits total setlist duration; removes songs until the total time is at or below the configured maximum.\r\n  - Must be added to the yaml and configured manually; can easily cause generation issues if not used carefully.\r\n- The selected goal song has been added to the spoiler log.\r\n- The spoiler log now lists what songs are unlocked from each song pack.\r\n- The base YARG setlist now always loads into the APWorld allowing unit tests and fuzzer runs pass properly.\r\n- Fix: Prevent song distribution from stealing plando\u2019d goal songs or pool inclusions to fill other pools.\r\n- Fix: The `YAYARG Song Data` folder is now always created when the world is loaded.\r\n- Fix: No longer create locations and items for for songs on instruments they don't have charts for.\r\n\r\n### Client Changes\r\n- Add a soft Song cap of 500 to the YAML creator. This can be bypassed, but will warn of issues with larger song list.\r\n- The keybind to open the connection window can now be remapped in the BepInEx config \r\n  - installation/BepInEx/config/thedrummonger.yarg.archipelago.cfg\r\n- Increased arbitrary setting caps in the YAML Creator to match APWorld limits.\r\n- The client will now refuse to connect to worlds generated with a different version.\r\n- Added a toggle to set what triggers a death link (client only toggle for now, no yaml setting) (#2) @ihavespoons\r\n- Fix: Restart Trap crash (hopefully for real this time).\r\n- Fix: Reload the song library on disconnect to remove AP headers.\r\n- Fix: Clamp any songs with negative intensity values to 0. Should fix Guitar Hero 1 - 3 exports not being recognized as valid songs.\r\n- Fix: Connection no longer blocks the game tread (#1) @alexkibler\r\n\r\nTested against [YARG nightly b3525](https://github.com/YARC-Official/YARG-Bleedingedge/releases/tag/b3525)\r\n***Newer version may be incompatible.***\r\n\r\n#### \u26a0\ufe0f Warning!\r\nYou **must** regenerate your song export list by rescanning your songs in YARG after installing the new plugin for this release.  \r\nIt\u2019s also recommended to delete and fully replace any older versions of the YAML Creator and its cache file.\r\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t, world generation **will** fail.\r\n\r\nThis version is **not compatible with older worlds.**\r\n\r\nSetup Guide:\r\nhttps://github.com/Thedrummonger/Archipelago/blob/YARGV2/worlds/yayarg/docs/guide_en.md",
