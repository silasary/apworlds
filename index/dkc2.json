If Diddy the reward will be extra lives, if Dixie the reward will be extra `Backup DK Barrel`s\r\n* There's a way to visualize in-game how many `Backup DK Barrel` items are left. A counter will appear on top of the player when they:\r\n    * Enter a level\r\n    * Use a `Backup DK Barrel`\r\n    * Gain a `Backup DK Barrel`\r\n    * Get hurt\r\n* It's now possible to run your own custom trivia database alongside the one provided in the apworld\r\n* Added options to change the Animal Buddies palettes\r\n* Added the current version to the Title Screen\r\n* Replaced the original credits text with text related to the people involved in the randomizer\r\n\r\n### Adjustments\r\n* A Diddy icon is shown instead of a Banana when you have an extra hit active\r\n* Getting hit while being protected by an Extra Hit will get rid of the current `Reverse Trap`\r\n* Getting hit while being protected by an Extra Hit now plays the Kong getting hurt sound effect\r\n* Renamed `player_palettes` and `player_palette_filters` options to `palettes` and `palette_filters` respectively to properly match their new purpose\r\n* Altered the default options to have a better \"new player\" experience\r\n* Reduced Swanky challenges cost, they now cost a single Banana Coin to try\r\n  * Swanky @ Galleon has all of his challenges available for free\r\n* You can no longer visit Cranky with `L` + `R` during the map\r\n* Reduced the chance of generating Banana Coins as filler items\r\n* Made `Backup DK Barrel`s appear more often as filler items\r\n* Updated the TrapLink database\r\n* Updated the trivia database\r\n  * We have over 600 questions now!\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n* Using Start Inventory From Pool (and possibly Plando as well) no longer has chance of picking UT's glitched item\r\n  * It's forced to replace items with Backup DK Barrels\r\n* Losing multiple Extra Hits inside hot/toxic water no longer spams hit detection VFX like crazy\r\n* Fixed being able to interact with Clapper on Lava Lagoon when it was submerged in liquid without unlocking him first\r\n* Jungle Jinx no longer loses most of its sounds effects when a `Backup DK Barrel` is requested or an Extra Hit is lost\r\n\r\n## Known issues\r\n* There's a rare chance of overloading the SFX queue which will cause the game to stop playing sounds and softlock upon triggering a screen transition\r\n* Castle Crush sometimes doesn't properly load messages\r\n* Banana Coins may randomly reset to 0 in rare situations",
