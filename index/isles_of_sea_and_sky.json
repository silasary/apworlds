A history of received items is saved to file when the game itself saves. This should prevent loss of progress in case of Resyncing, or mishaps. Consequently, location sending, and item receiving should no longer drop data.\r\n- Most Locations checks now send room position instead of item number in room.\r\n- Seashells now count as secrets, and now work with the HUD Hint system.\r\n- Receiving a Shard Hit item should no longer puts the player in an offset glitch state after the cutscene has ended.\r\n\r\n## AP World\r\n\r\n### Client\r\n\r\n- Reworked Item Receiving to better support Asyncs. Players should no longer lose their history of locations when they (dis)connect to the server.\r\n- NOTE: Cheating items from the server while on Asyncs don't have a working history, so the server will need to send multiple commands until it catches up to what the game has saved. (I.e. Sending 3 commands, (receiving 3 items) Resyncing, then sending 4 commands will result in 1 additional item.) Data has been made unique per item to mitigate this problem.\r\n\r\n### Logic\r\n\r\n- Added new subregions to Stony Cliffs, Raging Volcano for better logic handling of the Phoenix Flute\r\n- Many many many small rule tweaks. The player is significantly less likely to get stuck.\r\n\r\n### Locations\r\n\r\n- Many Location IDs have been reworked to prevent mixups between locations in the same room.",

While in the console the player can send the command `/auto_patch` to do everything automatically! As a bonus the original file is no longer altered, so updating between releases should work without any extra hassle. ***No need to download patch, as it is included in the APworld***\r\n\r\n**WARNING: If you have already modified the data.win file in the games steam install location, you will need to restore it back to normal for /auto_patch to work! You can do that in Steam like so:**\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6310c108-91e5-4ca4-9a63-1cd37601086b)\r\n\r\n\r\n### /create_patch\r\n\r\nThe method for creating patches has been migrated to the Client, which should speed up mod development! I built this for me, but it should allow others to share their own mods, assuming they use UndertaleModTool!\r\n\r\n### Secretsanity\r\n\r\nNew option available! there are a number of secret paths, and hidden objects in the game, and each discovery counts as a check! (24 checks)\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n### New Title Screen\r\n\r\nThe title screen has been altered to make it clear earlier on in game setup that patching was successful.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"651\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-06-05 071319\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b60540a4-2300-4401-954b-e5d3e3c6fb27\" />\r\n\r\n### Mercy Filler changed to Filler Composition\r\n\r\nThe option now works differently to be more intuitive to players: \r\n- Default: only allows Seashells as filler.\r\n- Extra Goodies: adds Ancient Keys , Star Pieces, and Gems to the filler pool. \r\n- - *AK(20% chance), SP (15%), Seashells (30%), G(35%)... Each Gem type is (8%), except Obsidian which is (4%)*\r\n- Only Goodies: replaces the entire filler pool with Ancient Keys, Star Pieces and Gems \r\n- - *AK(28%), SP(22%), G(50% (4 x 11% + 6%)).* \r\n\r\n### New Default Checks\r\nAdded 10 more default Location Checks\r\n- The Big Doors on Ancient Isle, and Stony Cliffs\r\n- the Bell Stones on Beast Bridge, and Sanctum\r\n- The  Gold/Blue Tablet puzzle clues on Stony Cliffs\r\n\r\n### Other Tweaks\r\n\r\n- Added a new subregion to Tidal Reef for better Phoenix Flute logic\r\n- Item pool will have an extra 6 Ancient Keys and an extra Star Piece due to some temporary fix that allows unittests to pass.\r\n- Many more Rule tweaks/fixes.\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "# First Alpha Release!\r\n\r\n## What's changed?\r\n\r\n- Nearly every item can be sent through Archipelago (Exceptions being Eggs, Wind Key, Music Puzzles, and a few Island Specific Puzzles). The four Giant Bells are both checks and items, as are Gem Quest Completions, and Sanctum Shard Hits. \r\n- Basic Logic implementation (It is still quite easy to get soft locked, but the game should be relatively completable).\r\n- A Completion when the Player gets to the end of the game, and initiates the Normal Ending cutscene.\r\n- An in-game console that displays the last few items that the player has received. This can be hidden by pressing 'C.'\r\n\r\n## What's wrong with it?\r\n\r\nBeyond basic functionality and passing unittests, there hasn't been extensive testing.\r\n\r\nFor testing purposes the in-game Dev Mode is enabled. Ctlr-G -> God Mode, Ctlr-T for Teleport Room, Ctlr-Y for item increments, Scroll-wheel for item spawn/destruction, Left-click for persistent-item activation(Doors, Keyblocks etc.)\r\n\r\n## What's Next?\r\n\r\nObviously bug fixes will be coming, but there are a few more ideas we can play with before we try on larger features. On the horizon, I think is adding in the Locations Items, and Options for both Shells and Jellyfish.\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/Kim-Delicious/Archipelago_IslesOfSeaAndSky/commits/v0.0.1",

      "description": "# The Locksanity Update!\r\n\r\nFind the [setup guide here.](https://github.com/Kim-Delicious/Archipelago_IslesOfSeaAndSky/blob/master/worlds/isles_of_sea_and_sky/docs/setup_en.md) There's some extra configuring needed with in-game options.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n### New Location Checks\r\n\r\n- Locksanity: with this enabled, every lock in the game counts as a check. This includes Ancient Locks, 3x and 6x Locks, the 3x Fire Lock, the Wind Lock, the Star Locks, and every Rune Lock (Ancient, Topaz, Sapphire, Ruby, Diamond, Obsidian). This totals to *101* new Checks! (I recommend playing with this on!)\r\n- Seashells: In the vanilla game there are hidden seashells in the Tidal Reef that are disabled. With this option, they are enabled, though some are quite tricky to find. This adds *24* new Checks\r\n- Jellyfish: With this option, the play can find jellyfish hidden throughout the Overworld. Adds *10* new checks.\r\n\r\nWith all three of these options enabled, the player may enjoy up to **135 extra checks!**\r\n\r\n### QOL\r\n\r\n- Altered Collectables: All items in-game now display an Archipelago sprite, and play the same sound when retrieved. Additionally other small effects have been removed from Rune Stones and Star Pieces. This is all so the player does not get confused when they pick up an item.\r\n- Icon Displays: Most items in the game are displayed when the player received them from the multiworld. Note that if a player receives many at the same time, they will overlap.\r\n- Sounds: When the player receives an item from the multiworld, the corresponding sound effect is played.\r\n- PhoenixAnywhere is an option that allows the player---while they have the Phoenix Flute---to summon the phoenix to any location, excluding the overworld. Keep in mind that the drop-off points are they same. (This is activated by pressing 'E')\r\n- LocalAncientIsle is an option that makes most of the items on the starting island the same as vanilla, to prevent early BK. This is enabled by default.\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes\r\n\r\n- The player can no longer be soft-locked by receiving any of the Bell cutscenes, nor the Shard Hit cutscenes.\r\n- The game no longer crashes when the player receives a cutscene that plays in the same room they start in.\r\n- Lots of minor things.\r\n\r\n## Known issues\r\n\r\n- Item Fill Logic has not been well defined, so it is likely that a playthrough cannot be completed without cheats.\r\n- If the player collects several items in succession too quickly, some will not be registered in-game.\r\n- YAML Settings do not yet translate into in-game options, and must be altered manually.\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/Kim-Delicious/Archipelago_IslesOfSeaAndSky/compare/v0.0.1...v0.0.2",

Game generation is now much more likely to be viable!\r\n- NOTE: Key amounts aren't yet taken into account for consecutive Locks.\r\n- The Player can now choose one of the other options in route_required, and Game generation will change.

This should help alleviate generation issues.\r\n- - 0: This will generate filler as only Seashells.

This gives the player a certain amount of 'lives' they can go through before they send a death to the server. The amount is set in the yaml, and can be adjusted with `/set_amnesty`\r\n\r\n#### Archipelago Options\r\n\r\n- A submenu has been added to the pause menu to contain Archipelago Options for the player to adjust as they see fit. So far there is only one.\r\n- - Player Speed: Adjusting this allows the player to move up to 4x the usual speed.\r\n- - WARNING: Use at your own risk. Some speeds may cause unintended behavior, such as altering the player's hitbox, and visual glitches \r\n\r\n### MISC\r\n\r\n- `/auto_patch` now validates the vanilla file, so players should have an explanation for failing to patch\r\n- `/auto_patch` auto launches the game!\r\n\r\n## Tweaks\r\n\r\n- The Topaz Rune Stone was added as an Early Item to prevent fill errors, since there are too few locations to complete the game on minimum options. Those errors should now be vanishingly rare.",

When the player receives a message, a panel peeks out from behind the GUI and displays it (with the associated colors)!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Traps!\r\n\r\nTraps are now in the game! Each of these has a sound, a unique effect, and a message that displays when the player gets one! Each trap has a timer on it that ticks down in the background until it clears its effects.\r\n\r\nHere they are!\r\n- Ice Trap\r\n- Magma Spirit Trap\r\n- Lava Spirit Trap\r\n- Metal Spirit Trap\r\n- Reversed Controls Trap\r\n- Floor Is Lava Trap\r\n- Tiny Trap\r\n- Fat Trap\r\n- Fast Trap\r\n- Slow Trap\r\n\r\n*There is a yaml option for TrapLink, but it does not yet function.*\r\n\r\nThere's some options in the .yaml to tune how many traps you get throughout a playthrough.\r\n\r\n### Alt Room Randomizer\r\n\r\nEARLY DEVELOPMENT!\r\n\r\nThis is a randomizer that relies on mixing and matching rooms made by the community. That means new puzzles, in unique rooms, and it should be compatible with the rest of an Archipelago experience! Rooms are turned into .json files, and loaded into the game on room transitions. It's a bit unorthodox, but I think it fits better for this game, than more traditional randomizers do for other games. You can read more [here](https://github.com/Kim-Delicious/Archipelago_IslesOfSeaAndSky/blob/master/worlds/isles_of_sea_and_sky/docs/en_Alt%20Room%20Randomizer.md)\r\n\r\nSo far there are two alternate rooms included in the apworld:\r\n- Ancient B3\r\n- Ancient B2\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n### Archipelago Options\r\n\r\nThe mod menu has been changed to allow multiple pages of options.\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\n- DeathLink should no longer flip-flop on tags when loading the DeathLink setting from a yaml, and connecting to a server.\r\n- Tons of other things along the way.",

Meaning that when you walk into a room the mod will find a relevant sprite to display instead of the generic one. There are some options in-game to turn these off. Learn how to easily set this up [here.](https://github.com/Kim-Delicious/Archipelago_IslesOfSeaAndSky/blob/master/worlds/isles_of_sea_and_sky/docs/setup_en.md#setup-custom-ap-sprites)\r\n<img width=\"959\" height=\"464\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-07-10 032420\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2a34d01-e4b6-40fd-8843-091b515bea10\" />\r\n## Changes\r\n- The way most location IDs are sent has been changed, now the rooms created for the Alt Room Randomizer can move around items without breaking registration with AP.\r\n- - @Wolicodes Spearheaded the change of location IDs in the apworld to make this work! Thanks Woli!!!\r\n- The Alt Room Randomizer Now has a chance to NOT choose a random room, so that subsequent playthroughs aren't locked out of vanilla rooms.\r\n- The Console Display now speeds up if the player has a long backlog of messages.\r\n- Save Files now use different names, so old saves from the vanilla game won't be erased or corrupted.\r\n- Renamed Traps\r\n- - Hotfoot Trap -> Floor Is Lava Trap\r\n- - Fat Trap -> Thicc Trap\r\n- Ice now displays a sprite on every tile it affects.\r\n- Woli changed the corner text that shows the room the player is in. Now it should reflect the names in-game, rather than the names used behind the scenes.\r\n- The sprites in place of Music Notes now fade in on approach.\r\n- Disabled the dance that interrupted the player. Now, only items that require a cutscene halt player movements.\r\n## Bugfixes\r\n- The game now properly loads the required route option, so alternative options like All Gems now function.\r\n- Floor Is Lava Trap no longer spawns in the overworld.\r\n- Ice Trap no longer spawns ice on the ocean, or the port. Significantly fewer bugs occur because of this.\r\n- Game no longer crashes when the Wind Key spawns\r\n- Minor Item and Logic fixes.",
