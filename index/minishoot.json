Those will be properly replaced when ER will be a thing.\r\n    - Dungeon 1 :\r\n        - One door leading to \"Dungeon 1 - South Item\" has been removed. This means that this dungeon now has an extra key.\r\n        - Removed the usage of the \"cannot_dash\" rule, meaning that small keys will likely be placed in the first part of the dungeon (when they are not shuffled).\r\n    - Dungeon 3 :\r\n        - One door leading to \"Dungeon 3 - South corridor\" has been removed. This means that this dungeon now has an extra key.\r\n        - Removed the usage of the \"cannot_surf\" rule.\r\n    - Abyss Church\r\n        - The Unchosen Statue is now opened by default (instead of being opened when the player defeats the boss of Dungeon 5).\r\n- Removed arbitrary logic rules for the fights against the boss of Dungeon 1 and the Busher boss in Forest (the one guarding the Spirit Tower).\r\n    - Those fights now only checks for cannon levels.\r\n- \"Dungeon 3 - North arena\" now properly checks for the \"Boostless Torch Races\" setting.\r\n- Renamed all instances of \"Mercant\" to \"Merchant\".\r\n- Temporarily removed file saving when receiving either a Small Key or a Boss Key.\r\n    - This change is made to alleviate issues where exiting the map screen can drastically drop the game framerate.\r\n    - This bug circumstances are still unclear, hence the temporary change.",
