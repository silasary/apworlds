You can also convert energy back into candies and lollipops.\r\n- Gifting support has been added - you can send and receive potions to and from other games.\r\n- You can opt to back your save up to the Archipelago server. This is useful if you are switching browsers, or giving your slot to someone else, who will be able to resume the game from where you left off.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the following bugs were fixed:\r\n- In some cases, even when you don't have the \"none\" weapon, the game would forcibly assign you the \"none\" weapon.\r\n- Chocolate bars were not completely tracked correctly - after erasing a game, you could re-spend chocolate bars that you had already spent.\r\n- The extra \"Connecting to Archipelago...\" text has been removed.\r\n- Support for Universal Tracker did not correctly track options.\r\n\r\nTested on AP 0.6.1, YMMV on later versions.
