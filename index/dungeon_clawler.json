(default: false). If disabled, you can still pick them but they won't get applied\r\n- Fixed an issue where you could reach the end of your perks and get stuck in various rooms where you are forced to pick a perk. Now, some \"real\" perks (not checks) are added at the end of the candidates list. Related to the above config\r\n- Fixed the build publishing process often being one version behind",
