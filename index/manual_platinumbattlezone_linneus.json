Since the items are not actually withheld from the player,\nthe player must manually refrain from using these gathered items until the tracker shows that they have been acquired or sent.",

      "description": "# Battle Zone Challenge 1.0.3 Release\r\n## ROM Changes\r\n- Made changes to the Battle Factory. Originally all pictures shown by the Factory Aides would display male Pok\u00e9mon sprites, breaking on every Female-only Pok\u00e9mon. The script will now check whether it has one of the Female-only Pok\u00e9mon and attempt to display a female sprite. As always, save before entering the Factory, and if you run into a female-only Pok\u00e9mon (cross-reference with [this list](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Gender#Single-gender_Pok%C3%A9mon)) or if this crash still occurs, please report it. Bear in mind that this crash will _not_ happen on DeSmuME.\r\n- Added one new sprite for the previously added secret.\r\n## APWorld Changes\r\n- Although the APWorld is included in this release, there have been no changes made. This APWorld is identical to the one found in previous versions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCheck the [README](https://github.com/Linneus/Platinum-Battle-Zone-Challenge/blob/main/README.md) for patching and randomizing instructions.\r\nMake sure to have [the latest APWorld for manual](https://github.com/ManualForArchipelago/Manual/releases) and the latest [Universal Tracker](https://github.com/FarisTheAncient/Archipelago/releases/)!\r\n\r\n**For those who are new to the Platinum AP Manual project**, you only need to download the .zip file.
