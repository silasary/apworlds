In the Archipelago launcher push the 'Generate Template Options' button to generate a yaml for your options\r\n2. Like every other apworld, fill out your yaml options and have the host generate the multiworld, the produced zip file should contain a .apsonicbattle patch file. Receive this .apsonicbattle patch from the multiworld host.\r\n3. Push the 'Open Patch' button in the launcher and it should ask for a 'Sonic Battle (US)' legal ROM dump (MD5 Hash: 100579ef01225c620560f88e65ca423a), then select the generated  .apsonicbattle patch file to produce a .gba ROM which should auto launch in a bizhawk instance. You should be set otherwise from here just follow the same instructions as any other supported Gameboy Advance apworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Locations\r\n- Story Battle and Events\r\n\r\n## Items\r\n- Character Story Unlocks\r\n- Zone Unlocks\r\n- Skill Cards\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\n- 7 Chaos Emeralds\r\n\r\n## Extra Features\r\n- Explosive core is now permanent and doesn't get consumed upon use but there is now only 1 in the item pool\r\n\r\n## Options\r\n- Color Palette Randomizer\r\n- Dialog randomizer\r\n- Sound Effect Randomizer\r\n- Music Randomizer\r\n- Deathlink\r\n\r\n## Thanks\r\nBig thanks to Giga Otomia for their extensive work on color palettes and Fluttershy0471 for testing",
