These each can be enabled or disabled.\r\n- Added \"Dreamworld Dungeons Do Not Change Items\" option, allowing for more varied Dreamworld experiences.\r\n- Added \"Open Dreamworld Dungeons\" setting. This does not remove the Raft requirement to enter Dreamworld, but it opens the first four dungeons in the Dreamworld to make \"Dreamworld Dungeons Do Not Change Items\" more viable.\r\n- Added \"Randomize Piano Puzzle\" option, allowing you to randomize the piano puzzle in Syncope.\r\n- Added \"Open Tomb of Simulacrum\" option, which removes the Forbidden Keys from the pool and makes Tomb of Simulacrum open by default.\r\n- Improved Key logic: Dungeons no longer expect you to have all keys to use any, but now only require the minimum \"safe\" amount of keys to use. This means that keys can for a dungeon can now be behind other locks in the dungeon.\r\n- Increased Dungeon Reward Count cap to 15.\r\n- Lockpicks now default to 12.\r\n- Bad Dream and The Promised Remedy are now Super Secret Locations.\r\n- Improved Phasing logic:\r\n  - Removed the old \"Itemless Phasing\" and \"Ice Phasing\" options.\r\n  - Added \"Gap Phasing\" and \"Object Phasing\" options that are easier to understand. They've been combined with \"Ice Dynamite Clips\" in a single \"Phasing Setting\" option.\r\n  - \"Object Phasing\" includes \"Gap Phasing\". \"Ice Dynamite Clips\" and \"Enemy Phases\" include both \"Gap Phasing\" and \"Object Phasing.\"\r\n  - Added \"Major Skips\" option to allow you to put some powerful skips in logic.\r\n- Cards are now filler and are only in the pool if Dreamworld is not randomized.\r\n- \"Sword\" and \"Mace\" can be used to hint Progressive Melee.\r\n- Removed upgrades from hint aliases as they took priority over the progressive versions of the items.\r\n- Fixed Yellow Hearts and Random Buffs not being properly added to the pool.\r\n- Fixed APWorld not using the randomization seed.\r\n\r\n## Client\r\n\r\n- Now supports the new goals. The escape \"X\" will not appear until the goal is reached.\r\n- Dreamworld, Secret Dungeon, Bad Dream, and The Promised Remedy locations are now randomized.\r\n  - You do not need any crayons or to wait to enter The Promised Remedy. However, you will need the Impossible Gates Pass and Fire Mace.\r\n  - Due to its difficulty, there is a guaranteed hint sign for the reward of The Promised Remedy in the first room.\r\n- Dreamworld dungeons may not restrict your items if the option is on.\r\n- Added Chests Match Contents option, which makes chests change colors to match what they contain. Details in Readme.\r\n- Syncope's piano puzzle may now be randomized. The solution can be found in the three knight's room.\r\n- Sending locations no longer causes the game to stutter.\r\n- Irresponsibly phasing is less likely to softlock you.\r\n- Removed the duplicate Syncope key.\r\n- Squashed some bugs:\r\n  - Saving & quitting in Former Colossus, quitting game, then reloading file no longer takes you to Machine Fortress\r\n  - Picking up keys/cards now play their sound effect\r\n  - Getting a Progressive Melee for another player while you already had Fire Mace now shows the Fire Mace icon\r\n  - Easy mode is now properly activated at start of file (previously, the setting was enabled, but it wasn't actually activated)\r\n  - Fixed an error that would happen when breaking objects that drop hearts\r\n  - Fixed Jenny Mole text being weird if no dungeons are required",

      "description": "This update doesn't add many more randomized locations, but it adds a lot of convenient Quality of Life features, as well as imprisons Ittle in Fluffy Fields...at least until she finds a Connection item.\r\n\r\n* Added a new goal: Potion Hunt!\r\n  * Once you find enough potions, Tippsie will build you a Raft and you can escape the island.\r\n  * You can require up to 20, and add up to an additional 20 spare potions.\r\n  * Potions will appear as the rewards of required dungeons.\r\n* Secret Signs can now be randomized!\r\n  * The Four Incomplete Signs and signs hidden in Portal Worlds give a location when you read them. Some of these can even be reached without items.\r\n  * Cipher Signs are only randomized if you also have Super Secrets on. This includes Cipher Signs in The Promised Remedy, significantly increasing the number of locations in there and increasing the value of Impossible Gates Pass and Fire Mace.\r\n* Improved Loot menu!\r\n  * You can now see the Impossible Gates Pass in the Loot Menu.\r\n  * You can switch your currently equipped outfit from a button in the Loot Menu.\r\n  * If Keysey is not on, you can access your key menu to see how many keys you have for each dungeon.\r\n  * If Potion Hunt is on, you can see the number of potions you have obtained.\r\n* Keys and Cards will now display their contents if Chests Match Contents is on. Beware of traps, they look identical to valuable items, but lack their permanence...\r\n* Region Connections!\r\n  * If you turn on \"Block Region Connections\", mysterious signs will block the paths between overworld regions (totally not inspired in design by Tunic) and an unknowingly unpaid intern will block interregional shortcut caves. You'll need to find Connection items to gain access to new parts of the overworld.\r\n  * If Chests Match Contents are on, connections appear as scrolls when not in a chest and in green chests with gold trims.\r\n  * Don't bother trying to use glitches to bypass the gates. The loading zones are outright disabled.\r\n  * You can see which connections are available and which are blocked from the map screen.\r\n* New Items:\r\n  * Lightning: Zaps all enemies near you, similar to the existing drop. In a few lucky situations you can use it to break logic...\r\n  * Meteor Shower Trap: Triggers Meteors for about 30 seconds regardless of the level you're in.\r\n  * Bee Onslaught Trap: Summons a swarm of swarm of bees.\r\n  * Matriarch Trap: Summons H\u0336\u0340\u030d\u0302\u031b\u0304\u0303\u033f\u0315\u0301\u0344\u0312\u0312\u0324\u032d\u0345\u0323\u0320E\u0334\u030d\u033e\u0305\u0300\u0351\u0350\u0306\u0313\u0300\u035c\u035c\u0323\u0348\u0322\u031d\u0333\u0348\u033c\u0319R\u0336\u0314\u030d\u030a\u031a\u030a\u0314\u0300\u0345\u033a\u0356\u033c\u0331\u035c\u0325\u0348\u0331\u031d\u032d\u0317\u0329\u032c\u0324\r\n  * Note: Bee Onslaught and Matriarch Traps are \"Super Traps\", a separate category of traps we felt were too debilitating for normal trap settings, and we have ideas for more in the future. You can select their trap chance separately from regular traps.\r\n* New Early Weapon Choice setting: You can now set a weapon (either melee, force, dynamite, or ice) to forcefully appear in Sphere 1. This can help improve the variety of seed starts. For example, if you're tired of constant early ice or stick seeds, you can try something like this:\r\n```yaml\r\n  early_weapon_choice:\r\n    # Force a specific weapon to be in Sphere 1.\r\n    # Since the randomizer will usually pick stick to be your earliest weapon if Randomize Stick is on, this setting\r\n    # can be used to try to force something else.\r\n    # Ice Ring is the easiest, Force Wand is the most limited, and Dynamite is the most difficult.\r\n    # Note that this setting will generally be completely ineffective if you don't Randomize Stick.\r\n    # Keeping the setting off lets Archipelago determine your earliest weapon, and may not put it in sphere 1.\r\n    'off': 0\r\n    melee: 0\r\n    force_wand: 50\r\n    dynamite: 50\r\n    ice_ring: 0\r\n```\r\n* Ice Ring can now be used to destroy the Lonely Road meteor.\r\n* Some miscellaneous Quality of Life:\r\n  * Maze of Steel cow now gets abducted immediately.\r\n  * Sweaty Fishbun in Fluffy Fields and Ogler in Fancy Ruins now move along their paths faster.\r\n  * Frozen Court ghosts are available all day and do not disappear when off-screen.\r\n  * Jenny Berry's house no longer requires waiting 30 seconds.\r\n* Various changes to scouting and data storage for trackers. (Thanks panicbit!)\r\n* Various bug fixes.\r\n* Various logic fixes.\r\n\r\nThanks to Scipio as always for helping with questions for development and arborelia for spell-checking some stuff and some bug fixes.\r\n",
