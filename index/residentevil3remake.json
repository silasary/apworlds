      "description": "It\u2019s been a while! This release is mainly focused on bug fixes, but also includes significant reworks to both the client and world.\r\n\r\n**All-in-One Client (RTX + Non-RTX)**\r\nYou no longer need to download separate clients\u2014both RTX and Non-RTX are bundled into a single, interchangeable download. If you decide to switch versions later, it\u2019s seamless. For now, the repo link will still say \u201cNon-RTX\u201d until the site and other references are updated, but both are the same package.\r\n\r\n**Clock Puzzle is Now \u201cProperly\u201d Randomized**\r\nThe clock puzzle has been reworked for proper randomization. That said, I still haven\u2019t tracked down the bug where the clock door can \u201cbreak\u201d in certain cases. As a temporary workaround, a button has been added to the Game Mod window that will manually close the door if needed. A full fix is planned for Version 3 of the randomizer.\r\n\r\n**Error Handling Improvements**\r\nDuplicate region issues that caused source errors have been fixed. In addition, the exception handling was adjusted to throw an OptionError if both Oops All options are enabled at the same time.\r\n\r\n**PopTracker Pack Overhaul**\r\nThe PopTracker pack has been fully updated (currently standard difficulty only). It now includes all new locations and supports the updated hint system\u2014so hinted locations will be visible directly in the tracker. Auto-tabbing and additional difficulties will be added after work on the RE2R tracker pack is finished.\r\n\r\n**No More Invincibility Issues!**\r\nA huge thanks to @FuzzyGamesOn for resolving the long-standing invincibility bug, as well as for implementing version matching. This means you no longer need to worry about whether you\u2019re on the latest release or not.\r\n\r\nBe sure to download latest client and apworld, and happy gaming!\r\n\r\nSide note: You no longer have a \"disconnect\" function, that prevents you from picking up items if you're not connected like in RE2R, be sure to be properly connected before playing your game.

      "description": "Almost entirely bugfixes, here's the scoop:\r\n\r\n   - Deathlink should now be working properly\r\n   - Fixed not being able to receive items after dying\r\n   - Acid/Flame Rounds were flip-flopped in the client, so you would never receive Flame Rounds (Even from the Supply Case that you get from Nemesis, which I thought was neat and gave me ideas for the future)\r\n   - Updated APworld to be compatible with 0.7.0 (no idea when this is happening)\r\n   - Updated Poptracker to address logic issues\r\n   \r\n***Be sure to update your RE3R APworld, Client and Poptracker Pack***\r\n\r\nThanks to @FuzzyGamesOn as always, and happy gaming!",
