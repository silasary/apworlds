Example: with star_spirits_required: 4 and require_specific_spirits: True, the generator could randomly choose for you to need the star spirits from chapters 1, 2, 5, and 7.\r\n\r\nLCL makes it so that chapters whose star spirits will only have junk items and the key items specific to those chapters. So, in the above example, chapters 3, 4, and 6 would have no logically relevant items. Instead they will be filled with consumables, badges, coins, and key items that aren't used outside of those specific chapters. This means you can choose to completely ignore and avoid Forever Forest, Boo's Mansion, Gusty Gulch, Tubba's Castle, Shy Guy's Toybox, and Flower Fields. \r\n\r\n#### Quick recap/other notes on LCL:\r\n- Out of logic chapters have no off world items\r\n- Useful items will stay in logic as much as possible\r\n- Many options are incompatible with LCL, particularly those that involve going to multiple chapters to unlock those checks (e.g. Koot favors, the letter chain when not fully shuffled)\r\n- Because these locations fill with only local items, the in logic locations will be more lacking in consumables than usual. Some players may prefer this, some may not; the behavior around what items get placed in the out of logic locations could be changed in the future. Make sure to give feedback on this if you have any.\r\n\r\nTry out LCL with 3 or 4 star spirits and see how it goes! It could end up being short enough for syncs where Paper Mario might've been too long before. ",

You will receive your items upon connecting to the server similar to how you would if they were sent to you. More info on how to use the start_items option [here.](https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/advanced_settings/en#universal-game-options)\r\n- `random_start_items` is now functional, and condenses what was previously 3 settings that weren't implemented. You can set this setting from 0 to 16 to be granted that many randomly selected items upon connecting to the server and starting your game. These items can include up to 10 consumables.\r\n- `blooper_damage_requirements` is a new setting with options `None`, `Low`, `Medium`, and `High`. Depending on the option, logic can be added to Blooper fights that make it so you aren't logically expected to fight them until you are well-equipped enough to do so.\r\n- `pmr_settings_string` is a new setting that allows you to take the Settings string from [the PMR Site,](https://pm64randomizer.com/) allowing you to use that for almost all of the YAML settings instead of editing a text file\r\n\r\n## Changes to existing features\r\n- Some or all chapter 8 locations now get set to Excluded based on the requirements for reaching Star Haven. This will reduce the chance of progression items being placed in this chapter.\r\n- `enemy_xp_multiplier` was previously changed to allow you to put in the multiplier you like without doing math, but it turns out that doing that made it so that non-integer multipliers wouldn't work. So we're back to needing to use a value of 4 for double XP, 2 for vanilla XP, 3 for 1.5XP, etc.\r\n\r\n## Other\r\n- Docs got updated and moved around some. Everything aside from the ReadMe is now in the docs folder.\r\n",

This means that even for solo games (you should _probably_  just use [the normal randomizer](https://pm64randomizer.com/) instead of AP), you'll need to connect to the server (even if it's just a local server) to get your starting boots/hammer if you granted yourself any. This was done to fix an issue with trackers not knowing what gear (or partner) you started with.\r\n- Some QoL settings that defaulted to off now default to on. Why would you not want Speedy Spin, anyways?\r\n- Receiving consumables from other players while your inventory is full makes the received item disappear, with no way of getting it back. This is still the case, but you are now allowed to generate with the setting set to less than 100 at their own risk. It's very much recommended against because you could end up in fairly dire straits without consumables being more accessible. But, given the other goofy stuff AP and PMR can allow, if you want to make yourself suffer, go for it.  Just know you've been warned.\r\n- Reduced MultiWorld item prices from 35 to a random multiple of 5 between 10 and 30\r\n## Bugfixes/Corrections\r\n- Fixed item rules (which prevent items from going into locations that the game can't handle) to allow non-local items, which will help generation\r\n- Added a default value to the pmr_settings_string setting to prevent issues with the auto-generated yaml template\r\n- The Out of Bounds/Loading Zone Storage setting now gets set properly in the rom\r\n- Quake Bounce's name in the client now matches its in game name\r\n- Fixed boss, NPC, enemy, and hammer color palettes not being set properly in the rom when choosing random options\r\n- Changed keysanity: false's fill to allow excluded locations so that Bowser's Castle key placement doesn't get inhibited by excluded locations",

      "description": "## New features\r\n- Features added to Paper Mario Randomizer in the [0.27.0 release](https://pm64randomizer.com/changelog) including Star Beam Shuffle and the various changes to the goal options have been added to the Archipelago implementation! For a full list of those changes, check out the change log for their release above.\r\n- For Star Beam Shuffle, upon reaching Bowser without Star Beam, he will tell you its location. If it is in your world, he will give you the region that it is in. If it is not in your world, he will tell you it is in Rogueport, meaning that it is in someone else's world. It is planned to be either baked into the rom or otherwise revealed without needing to spend hint points in the future, but for the moment you will have to use AP's hint system if you wish to know its exact location.\r\n- There is a sign at Shooting Star Summit and in the Sanctuary of the Stars to tell you what the requirements are for Star Way and the Star Beam check respectively.\r\n- Both Star Way and the Star Beam check can now be set to unlock with spirits, power stars, or any combination of the two. This means you can require both 5 spirits AND 50 power stars to enter Star Haven, rather than one or the other.\r\n- The seed goal can now be set to Open Star Way, which will cause the game to end once you have opened Star Way instead of going to defeat Bowser. Before you could do this for Power Star Hunt, but now you can do it regardless of your goal settings.\r\n\r\n## Changes to existing features\r\n- The dark cave rooms in Bowser's Castle now logically require you to have Watt to traverse them.\r\n- The PMR Settings String will now work again if you want to use the PMR site to choose your options. Old strings will no longer work.",
