      "description": "This is the official release of the Clique AP World, based on 1.5.4 of the [Clique](https://clique.pharware.com) browser game.\r\n\r\nA template YAML for Clique is also included as `Clique.yaml`.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nTo install, drag the `clique.apworld` file into your Archipelago `custom_worlds` folder or click \"Install APWorld\" in the Archipelago Launcher and select `clique.apworld`.\r\n\r\nRequires [Archipelago](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases/latest) to generate since 0.6.2 of Archipelago.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n### Client Changes\r\n\r\n- Game now reports as supporting AP version 0.5.0 when connecting to an Archipelago server.\r\n  - Repository has not be updated with this (yet), but it is live on the site.\r\n\r\n### APWorld Changes\r\n\r\n- Added a new option: `force_progression` which forces a progression item on \"The Button\".\r\n  - Default is `true` and works like the previous version included in Archipelago (<= 0.6.1).\r\n- Updated the slot data to include `hard_mode` setting and `world_version`.\r\n- Updated \"The Button\" to allow \"Button Activation\" items to be placed.\r\n- Refactored a lot of code for simplicity.\r\n- Renamed \"The Big Red Button\" to \"The Button\".\r\n- Renamed \"The Item on the Desk\" to \"The Free Item\".\r\n- Removed setup documentation (will be rewritten on the front-end in the Clique v2 update).\r\n- Removed event items/locations from spoiler.\r\n  - Never made sense for a game this simple anyway.",
