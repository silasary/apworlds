      "description": "### **Initial release for Super Cat Planet AP!!!!**\r\n\r\nThis is going to be pretty buggy but I have most of the core features I wanted!!!!\r\nPlease direct all bug reports to either the issues section of this repo or to the [discord thread!!!](https://discord.com/channels/731205301247803413/1338978189682409473)\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\nActually insanely simple. CatPlanetSuperAP.zip contains the game application, which has all of the archipelago functionality built-in! Some nice stuff you can do:\r\n- On connection screen: `Tab` cycles to next field, `Shift+Tab` cycles to previous field, `Enter` submits connection info\r\n- Ingame: \\` allows you to type to the text client, `Enter` sends a message, \\` stops type-mode without sending a message.\r\n- Main menu: Press the AP Logo to go back to the connection screen! (or press `F5` at any time, but I recommend holding the 'menu' hotkey that you set during setup instead!) You can also reset to spawn if you get stuck.\r\n\r\nOther than that, just download and double-click `scp.apworld` and your Archipelago install will automatically set it up for you!\r\n",

      "description": "# UT Support Update!!!\r\nadded UT support for the random button walls option!!! careful, it _will_ spoil what areas you have access to!\r\nalso fixed a bunch of other stuff I should have fixed a long time ago!!\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed a crash that occurred when receiving either yellow button under certain conditions\r\n- Fixed the Dye Shop Cat location missing from the apworld\r\n- Fixed the Ice Caves Secret Costume not sending a check in most situations\r\n- Fixed a softlock that occurred when leaving the options menu while already connected; now, leaving the options menu will send you to the main menu instead of the connection screen\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Added UT Support!\r\n- Added support for compressed websocket compression, doing away with that pesky warning on startup\r\n- Changed the savefile name so that you can play AP without interrupting your vanilla save/config! The file location is the same.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n- Various collision issues which I couldn't solve. If you notice a crow clipping through a gate, or the player getting stuck on a button / wall, please let me know where and how!!\r\n- UT gives an error about a missing YAML / failed generation, but then functions perfectly fine.\r\n- The warp room provides access to all regions, even if they're out of logic. I plan to include the warp room as a hub when I add starting location randomization, so I have not addressed this yet.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's all!!! Thanks for playing!!! remember to leave bug reports, ideas, and feedback in the [discord thread!!!](https://discord.com/channels/731205301247803413/1338978189682409473)",

(finally!!!!)\r\n- Fixed void and warp room text coloring (to avoid black-on-black).\r\n- Fixed some issues regarding escape characters in the text client output.\r\n- Fixed the logic on one cat at the bottom left of Ice Caves, which is inaccessible when entering the region from the top with no white switch.\r\n\r\nWith this done, I should be able to add some new features soon :3 next up is probably going to just be new color schemes for the text client output, but after that I can finally start working on start area randomization!! probably not very soon though",
