Since the items are not actually withheld from the player,\nthe player must manually refrain from using these gathered items until the tracker shows that they have been acquired or sent.",

Before starting your game, follow the installation instructions for UModFramework and the SR Cheat Menu mod.\r\n\r\nIt is highly suggested to have the [Slime Rancher Interactive Map](https://mapgenie.io/slime-rancher/maps/far-far-range) open while you play. \r\n\r\nIn order to play this manual:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new save file\r\n2. Follow the initial tutorial\r\n3. Use SR Cheat Menu to gift yourself 10,000 newbucks\r\n4. Unlock The Lab\r\n5. Follow the tutorial for slime science, giving yourself enough plorts to craft the single novice drill\r\n6. Delete the novice drill from your inventory after completing the tutorial\r\n\r\nAfter this point, you MAY store items in the refinery, but you MAY NOT do anything else in the Lab until you receive the `Ranch Expansion - The Lab`. This includes crafting gadgets, triggering the Hobson's note, or opening the treasure pod.\r\n\r\n## What is shuffled?\r\n\r\nItems:\r\n- The ability to unlock Vackpack upgrades. When receiving a Vackpack upgrade item, you should cheat yourself enough Newbucks to purchase it. You still must meet all other requirements to have the item appear in the shop.\r\n- Unlocking slime doors. If you get more slime doors than you have opened Gordos, you may cheat yourself additional slime keys. You may not unlock doors without receiving their slime door item.\r\n- Map Data nodes. You cannot unlock a map data node until you receive the Map Data item\r\n- Static Teleporters. You cannot use a teleporter until you unlock it.\r\n- Newbucks. When you receive Newbucks, cheat them to yourself.\r\n- Gadgets. When you receive a gadget, cheat it to yourself.\r\n- Ranch Expansions. When you receive a Ranch Expansion, cheat yourself enough Newbucks to purchase it.\r\n\r\nLocations:\r\n- Gordos\r\n- Treasure Pods\r\n- Hobson's Notes [Optional - Notesanity YAML option]\r\n- Ranching various Largos or specific slimes [Optional - Ranchsanity YAML option]\r\n- 7Zee Rewards Levels [Optional - SevenZeeRewards YAML option]\r\n\r\nGoals:\r\n- Default: Reach the Hobson's Note at the very end of the Glass Desert\r\n- Optional: Reach 7Zee Rewards Level 28\r\n",
