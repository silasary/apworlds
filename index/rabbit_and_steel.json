      "description": "# Rabbit and Steel Archipelago v0.1.1\r\n[Release Page](https://github.com/tjwombo/RNSArchipelago/releases/tag/release) | [Setup](https://github.com/tjwombo/RNSArchipelago#installation)\r\n\r\nInitial release of Rabbit and Steel for Archipelago \ud83e\udd73 ! This is early alpha and will very likely have random crashes, caution is advised. \r\n\r\n## Here's the list of features:\r\n\r\n- Kingdom Sanity\r\n    - Kingdoms must be found before they can be visited\r\n- Max Kingdoms Per Run\r\n    - The number of kingdoms you visit before header to the pale keep\r\n- Progressive Regions\r\n    - How many regions you are currently allowed to visit in a run\r\n    - Includes the Pale Keep and Moonlit Pinnacle, excludes Kingdom Outskirts\r\n - Kingdom Order\r\n     - Logical order kingdoms are expected to traverse\r\n     - Valid values are 0 to the max kingdoms per run setting (inclusive), where 0 will randomly assign an order prioritizing unfilled orders then highest order on a tie\r\n     - Invalid values will result in the kingdom not being added to the pool and inaccessible.\r\n     - The in game route selection will prioritize following an incremental route order, but if you can visit say 3 kingdoms and only have kingdoms with route orders 1, 1, and 2; you will visit one of the 1s then the 2 and then the last 1 (I think)\r\n     - However, you will also be able to select your first kingdom as long as its logically accessible\r\n         - Do not trust the kingdom you have selected when you join a lobby from the settings screen, if you want a specific kingdom select off it and then back on it\r\n    - Generation will throw an error if there are not enough valid kingdoms or if there isn't at least one kingdom in each order from 1 to max kingdoms per run after the random assignment\r\n- Class Sanity\r\n    - Classes must be found before they can be played\r\n    - A special starting class item will be added to the lobby screen that gives you a random starting class\r\n        - Sometimes the items don't send, please try leaving the lobby and rejoining as its usually worked for me second time\r\n- Checks Per Class\r\n    - Classes that have locations associated with them\r\n    - The generic location will still exist, and any class can obtain them\r\n    - The values should start with a capital letter like Heavyblade\r\n- Shuffle Item Sets\r\n    - Item sets must be found before they can appear in a non archipelago treasuresphere\r\n- Checks Per Item In Chest\r\n    - Each item in an archipelago treasuresphere is an archipelago item\r\n    - Shuffles 5 non archipelago treasurespheres into the item pool\r\n        - When you receive a treasuresphere it should appear as the next 'encounter'\r\n        - When you start a new run, you should start with all the treasurespheres you've unlocked\r\n    - Does not add a check per item if Checks Per Class is on\r\n- Upgrade Sanity\r\n    - Determines what is required for an upgrade to appear in a shop\r\n    - Upgrade will be randomly chosen from the available options\r\n    - None: All upgrades are available from the start\r\n    - Simple: Just need to get the type of upgrade to unlock them for all attacks, i.e. Ruby Upgrade unlocks Ruby Primary, Ruby Secondary, etc..\r\n    - Full: Need to get Ruby Primary Upgrade to unlock that primary upgrade\r\n- Potion Sanity\r\n    - How the top shelf of the shop appears\r\n    - None: Default behavior\r\n    - Locked: HP and level up will always be in their position, once their item is found, and the 3 potions will be randomly selected from the pool of obtained potions\r\n    - Roulette: Any item on the top shelf can appear in any position\r\n        - Slots continue to have their original behavior, you can only buy the item in the HP slot if your not at full health, can buy level up slot infinitely, and buy each potion slot once\r\n- Shop Sanity\r\n    - Shops contain AP items to purchase, and the AP item is required to purchase before you can purchase the normal shop item for that slot\r\n    - None: Shops do not carry any AP items\r\n    - Global: Shops carry the same AP items, and only need to be purchased once to unblock the slot\r\n    - Regional: Each kingdom contains their own AP items that need to be purchased\r\n- Goal Condition\r\n    - Currently only have a goal to defeat Shira x number of times with unique classes\r\n- Shira Defeats\r\n    - If goal is set to Shira, determines how many unique classes must defeat Shira to goal\r\n\r\n## Misc\r\n\r\n- Multiplayer is not currently supported, it might work but I haven't tested it\r\n- Buying a shop AP item currently refreshes the entire store selection\r\n- AP items in the shop don't actually cost anything currently\r\n- I haven't tested receiving a treasuresphere with itemset shuffle on, but receiving no itemsets\r\n- When going through the treasurespheres at the start of a new run, the adventure hasn't 'started' so players can still join as if it was the preparing screen\r\n- Don't modify the lobby settings while inside the lobby, I don't think it would break anything but I also don't think it would fix anything your trying to fix\r\n- If your screen is frozen, make sure you don't have any selected text on the Reloaded 2 console\r\n    - You can fix it by right clicking anywhere on the console\r\n- The gold item doesn't do anything currently",
