      "description": "# Release v0.0.10 - The Great Refactor\r\n\r\n## 1/18/2024 Update Note\r\nThere was an issue with the initial release of this build. I've updated the mod and apworld files to fix this.\r\n\r\n## 1/20/2024 Update Note\r\nFixed an issue when multiple worlds were genned together.\r\n\r\n## Release Notes\r\nThis update sees the completion of the first major wave of the logic rewrite. This removes monsters from the general item pool and overhauls the logic that the apworld uses to place items.\r\n\r\nThe biggest change is that monster randomization is now much more thorough that it used to be, which should massively reduce (or eliminate) unbeatable seeds\r\n\r\n## Key Logic\r\nKey logic was also rewritten. Two new options were created to remove locked doors and control how keys are randomized. By default, the logic will always assume that keys are used in the exact same order, outlined below.\r\n- Blue Caves: North switches door, champion door, south door to underworld\r\n- Stronghold dungeon: Eastern shortcut door, south library door\r\n- Ancient Woods: Center door to access the east side, champion door\r\n- Magma Chamber: Alchemist lab door, mozzie room door\r\n\r\nMountain Path, Underworld and Mystical Workshop only have a single locked door (or set of locked doors) and thus are unchanged.\r\n\r\n## Remove options\r\n- `randomize_champions`\r\n- `champions_in_wild`\r\n- `evolutions_in_wild`\r\n\r\n## New Options\r\n- `randomize_monsters`: \r\n\t- Randomization rules for monsters\r\n\t- 0: Monsters are not randomized\r\n\t- 1: Monsters are entirely randomized, with every monster replaced with any other monster\r\n\t- 2: Monsters of the same specie are all randomized to another monster specie (this is how the built-in randomizer works)\r\n \t- 3: Within a given encounter, all monsters of the same specie are randomized to another specie. Each encounter is randomized entirely separately.\r\n- `improved_mobility_limit`\r\n\t- Restrict placement of monsters with improved mobility abilities (improved flying, improved swimming, dual mobility, and lofty mount)\r\n \t- 0: Do not restrict placement of these monsters\r\n  \t- 1: Monsters with these abilities will not show up in the Mountain Path, Blue Caves, Stronghold Dungeon, Snowy Peaks, Sun Palace, or Ancient Woods.\r\n- `remove_locked_doors`\r\n\t- Removes locked doors\r\n \t- 0: Do not remove any locked doors\r\n  \t- 1: Remove extraneous locked doors such that each area only has one place where keys are used\r\n  \t- 2: Remove all locked doors\r\n- `local_area_keys`\r\n\t- Controls where area keys can be placed\r\n \t- 0: Area keys can show up anywhere in any world (following normal logic rules)\r\n  \t- 1: Area keys will only show up in the Monster Sanctuary player's world, and they will only appear in their own area\r\n- `add_gift_eggs_to_pool`\r\n\t- Adds eggs you would normally receive from NPCs to the item pool so their location is randomized. Gift monsters are: Koi, Skorch, Shockhopper, and Bard\r\n \t- 0: Gift monsters are received in their normal location (though the monster you receive may be different depending on monster randomization rules)\r\n  \t- 1: Gift monster eggs are added to the item pool and can appear anywhere (following normal logic rules)",

Any scene that includes a battle, or has lots of branching dialog will remain. This simply removes the requirement to complete certain areas before moving on to others.\r\n- When an encounter is complete, the client will now Check the locations with Archipelago. This doesn't do anything other than let the tracker keep more up to date with the actual % complete.\r\n- Fixed a bug where horizon beach as considered accessible even if you didn't defeat the goblin king encounter. Now the logic will correctly route goblin king before going to horizon beach\r\n- Handful of world graph fixes.",

From this point on until 1.0 release the only code changes will be to fix bugs and oversights.\r\n\r\n## What's new\r\n### AP World Updates\r\n- All locations have been given unique, descriptive names. Now when you get hints from the multiworld server it will display these names instead of the logical names (\"MountainPath_North4_3\") it was using before.\r\n\r\n### Client Updates\r\n- When loading or starting a new save file, if you are not connected to a multiworld server, then the client will prompt you to connect using the last known connection settings before continuing. If you are starting a new file, it will pre-populate the character name with your multiworld player name.\r\n  - This should all but eliminate players accidentally loading a save and opening chests before connecting to a multiworld server.\r\n- The in-game map now tracks which checks have been completed on the in-game map and minimap using map pins. The map pin names indicate how many checks are within a given tile, and are automatically added and removed as checks are completed.\r\n- The client now tracks which checks are completed while not connected to a multiworld server, and as long as you connect before closing the game, you will receive items for those checked locations.\r\n- The client now sends a Death Link message when the player loses a battle (only if Death Link is enabled in the settings)\r\n- Fixed some flags in Horizon Beach that were not being set when `skip_plot` was enabled\r\n- Defeating the Mad Lord now sends a completion event to AP (when the `goal` setting is set to defeating the Mad Lord)\r\n- All champion fights now have their level set based on the automatic world scaling. This stops super-champions from always being locked at level 42.\r\n\r\n### AP World Settings\r\n- `improved_mobility_limit` is now a toggle, and the areas in which improved movement abilities can appear has been expanded to include Horizon Beach and Magma Chamber\r\n- Added `hints` toggle option (defaults to enabled). When enabled, the locations for a number of checks are added to NPC dialog. See below for more details\r\n\r\n### Hints\r\nWhen the option is enabled (see Settings above), There are a number of static hints that have been added to NPC dialog. The list of hints is as follows:\r\n- The first stone slab you encounter in Mountain Path will tell you what Tanuki is randomized to\r\n- The dialog with your familiar when you approach the Underworld door in the Blue Caves will tell you in what areas or worlds you can find the Sanctuary Tokens\r\n- The guy next to the lake in the Snowy Peaks will tell you in what area you can find Akhlut\r\n- The Clothesmaker will tell you the classification of the item that she will make, and will tell you the area or world where you can find the Warm Underwear\r\n- The Cryomancer tells you what areas Dodos can be found in.\r\n- After finishing Sun Palace, The Caretaker will tell you in which area or world you can find the Koi Egg (if it's in the item pool)\r\n- The fisherman at Horizon Beach will tell you the classification (junk, useful, progression) of item that is the reward for collecting 5 rare seashells\r\n- The Old Man at Horizon Beach will tell you the classification of item that is the reward for returning the Memorial Ring. He will also tell you what area or world the Memorial ring is located in.\r\n- The guy standing next to the blob status in Magma Chamber will tell you what area or world the Blob Key is in.\r\n- Dialog with the Runestone in Magma Chamber will hint at the area or world where you can find the Runestone Shard\r\n- Several of the stone slabs in the Forgotten world will hint at the areas where you can tame Krakaturtle, Amberlgna, and Gryphonix\r\n- The stone slab in the World Tree room of the Forgotten World will hint at the classification of the item received by delivering 3 Celestial Feathers\r\n- The journals in the study room of the Forgotten World hints in what area or world the Bard Egg is in\r\n\r\n### What Won't be in the 1.0 Release\r\nThough I would like to support all of these features in the future, they will not be added for a 1.0 release.\r\n- Full death link support. Monster Sanctuary doesn't really have a built-in penalty for losing, so anything added here will need to be designed from scratch.\r\n- Trap items. As above, Monster Sanctuary doesn't have anything that fits this category as default.\r\n- Entrance randomizer. I really want this one, but better to save it for later.\r\n- New Game+ support. NG+ doesn't really jive with the idea of a randomizer, so it doesn't make the cut\r\n- Bravery mode support. As is, Bravery mode would require some serious logic concessions. I'd like to work on that after the base game is proven solid.\r\n- Randomized Familiar. I tried to get this one working, but the way the game is coded makes it quite difficult. Saving it for later.\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\n- If the Cryomancer gives you an monster egg as a reward, that egg is always normal shifted even if you would normally get a dark or light shifted egg.",

      "description": "## What's Changed\r\n- monster_sanctuary_mod.zip\r\n- monster_sanctuary.apworld\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\nIt's gotta happen at some point, so I'm considering this release the end of the beta period. The mod and AP world have all the core features required for a solid experience, and is mostly bug-free. Is this the end of development? Absolutely not, I have a ton of features I'm excited to add, and of course I will be fixing issues that pop up. But I can't be chasing perfect forever, so this is it for first full release.\r\n\r\n## Fixes and Updates in 1.0.11\r\n### Client\r\n- Players no longer receive items while mid-air (which would kill any momentum and could ruin some platforming)\r\n- Guaranteed eggs given as battle rewards retain the shift status of the monsters\r\n- If the cryomancer light and dark shifted egg checks have eggs at that location, then those eggs are correctly shifted (to light or dark, respectively)\r\n- Checking multiple items in quick succession no longer causes items to be skipped (Smith checks, Buran checks, Velvet Melody checks, etc)\r\n- Map pins now correctly update when multiple checks are done in quick succession\r\n- The Aazerach fight now correctly triggers based on whether you have the Ahrimaaya item, and doesn't require starting the quest with Trevisan)\r\n- The Velvet Melody checks now correctly trigger based on whether you have Mozzie\r\n- The Mozzie check remains accessible even if you already have Mozzie (though the sprite for Mozzie won't appear, the cut-scene will still play out)\r\n- Moved data storage updates to a background thread to prevent the client from freezing for a few frames\r\n- The progress text for the \"Defeat all champions\" goal now correctly tracks champions defeated\r\n- Champion fights correctly track, even if the same monster is placed in multiple champion spots\r\n- Fixed a bug that caused a player to receive items a second time if they restarted their save file\r\n\r\n### AP World\r\n- Duel Circle is now correctly placed in sphere 0 if skip_plot is enabled\r\n- Blue Caves dark room now requires double jump\r\n- Fixed a number of requirement errors in Ancient Woods\r\n- Fixed a broken region connection from Ancient Woods South to the Hidden Tunnels\r\n- The breakable wall near the Brutus fight is now only accessible from the east (it can only be broken in one direction)\r\n- The check \"Underworld - Eric Battle\" has been renamed to \"Underworld - Leonard Battle\"\r\n- The Wanderers gift at the World Tree now requires freeing him in addition to defeating the Dracomer champion\r\n- The exit from Forgotten World to Magma Chamber now requires opening from the Magma Chamber side AND the Forgotten World side\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n- Holding B to skip the intro cut scene causes the game to proceed with all of the tutorial dialog, rather than skipping it, even if skip_intro is enabled.",

      "description": "## Fixes and Updates in 1.0.2-beta\r\n- When `skip_plot` is disabled, AP logic now correctly requires the player to complete the Stronghold Dungeon and Ancient Woods storylines in order to access the Underworld (in addition to having all Sanctuary Tokens). This will prevent items required for stronghold dungeon and ancient woods stories being locked in the Underworld.\r\n- Defeating all champions now triggers game completion when the goal is set accordingly.\r\n- Defeating champions no longer cause exception loops.\r\n- When quitting to menu, you are now disconnected from AP.\r\n- Fixed an issue where items sent by the server via command would get delivered multiple times.\r\n- Fixed an issue where the first item received from the server would be doubled-up\r\n- Minor fixes when playing the game disconnected from Archipelago\r\n\r\n## The Road to 1.0\r\nThis release marks the end of the initial development phase, and the start of the beta testing and code hardening phase. From this point on until 1.0 release the only code changes will be to fix bugs and oversights.\r\n\r\n## What's new\r\n### AP World Updates\r\n- All locations have been given unique, descriptive names. Now when you get hints from the multiworld server it will display these names instead of the logical names (\"MountainPath_North4_3\") it was using before.\r\n\r\n### Client Updates\r\n- When loading or starting a new save file, if you are not connected to a multiworld server, then the client will prompt you to connect using the last known connection settings before continuing. If you are starting a new file, it will pre-populate the character name with your multiworld player name.\r\n  - This should all but eliminate players accidentally loading a save and opening chests before connecting to a multiworld server.\r\n- The in-game map now tracks which checks have been completed on the in-game map and minimap using map pins. The map pin names indicate how many checks are within a given tile, and are automatically added and removed as checks are completed.\r\n- The client now tracks which checks are completed while not connected to a multiworld server, and as long as you connect before closing the game, you will receive items for those checked locations.\r\n- The client now sends a Death Link message when the player loses a battle (only if Death Link is enabled in the settings)\r\n- Fixed some flags in Horizon Beach that were not being set when `skip_plot` was enabled\r\n- Defeating the Mad Lord now sends a completion event to AP (when the `goal` setting is set to defeating the Mad Lord)\r\n- All champion fights now have their level set based on the automatic world scaling. This stops super-champions from always being locked at level 42.\r\n\r\n### AP World Settings\r\n- `improved_mobility_limit` is now a toggle, and the areas in which improved movement abilities can appear has been expanded to include Horizon Beach and Magma Chamber\r\n- Added `hints` toggle option (defaults to enabled). When enabled, the locations for a number of checks are added to NPC dialog. See below for more details\r\n\r\n### Hints\r\nWhen the option is enabled (see Settings above), There are a number of static hints that have been added to NPC dialog. The list of hints is as follows:\r\n- The first stone slab you encounter in Mountain Path will tell you what Tanuki is randomized to\r\n- The dialog with your familiar when you approach the Underworld door in the Blue Caves will tell you in what areas or worlds you can find the Sanctuary Tokens\r\n- The guy next to the lake in the Snowy Peaks will tell you in what area you can find Akhlut\r\n- The Clothesmaker will tell you the classification of the item that she will make, and will tell you the area or world where you can find the Warm Underwear\r\n- The Cryomancer tells you what areas Dodos can be found in.\r\n- After finishing Sun Palace, The Caretaker will tell you in which area or world you can find the Koi Egg (if it's in the item pool)\r\n- The fisherman at Horizon Beach will tell you the classification (junk, useful, progression) of item that is the reward for collecting 5 rare seashells\r\n- The Old Man at Horizon Beach will tell you the classification of item that is the reward for returning the Memorial Ring. He will also tell you what area or world the Memorial ring is located in.\r\n- The guy standing next to the blob status in Magma Chamber will tell you what area or world the Blob Key is in.\r\n- Dialog with the Runestone in Magma Chamber will hint at the area or world where you can find the Runestone Shard\r\n- Several of the stone slabs in the Forgotten world will hint at the areas where you can tame Krakaturtle, Amberlgna, and Gryphonix\r\n- The stone slab in the World Tree room of the Forgotten World will hint at the classification of the item received by delivering 3 Celestial Feathers\r\n- The journals in the study room of the Forgotten World hints in what area or world the Bard Egg is in\r\n\r\n### What Won't be in the 1.0 Release\r\nThough I would like to support all of these features in the future, they will not be added for a 1.0 release.\r\n- Full death link support. Monster Sanctuary doesn't really have a built-in penalty for losing, so anything added here will need to be designed from scratch.\r\n- Trap items. As above, Monster Sanctuary doesn't have anything that fits this category as default.\r\n- Entrance randomizer. I really want this one, but better to save it for later.\r\n- New Game+ support. NG+ doesn't really jive with the idea of a randomizer, so it doesn't make the cut\r\n- Bravery mode support. As is, Bravery mode would require some serious logic concessions. I'd like to work on that after the base game is proven solid.\r\n- Randomized Familiar. I tried to get this one working, but the way the game is coded makes it quite difficult. Saving it for later.\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\n- If the Cryomancer gives you an monster egg as a reward, that egg is always normal shifted even if you would normally get a dark or light shifted egg.\r\n- You can trigger the battle and cut-scene to open the Underworld door with only 4 sanctuary tokens, instead of the expected 5.\r\n- Monster eggs in the item pool do not respect the 'limit improved mobility abilities' rule, and can be placed anywhere according to logic.",

      "description": "## What's Changed\r\n- monster_sanctuary_mod.zip\r\n- monster_sanctuary.apworld\r\n- MonsterSanctuary.yaml\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\nThis update is mostly to get the mod back in a good state. Nearly all of the v1.1 features have been removed for now. Removed features include:\r\n- Open world settings\r\n- Shop randomizer\r\n- Eggsanity checks\r\n- Locked explore abilities\r\n- Monster Army checks\r\n- Trap items\r\n- Mozzie goal\r\n- Monster Journal goal\r\n\r\nThe intent is to re-add these features in the future as long as the apworld and client remain stable. \r\n\r\n## Fixes and Updates in 1.2.0\r\n### AP World\r\n- Ported in world graph fixes from the v1.1 branch\r\n- Ported in fixes from Witchybun\r\n- Removed the exp_multiplier from the AP world options, and added it to the client mod options (see below)\r\n- Remove skip_intro from the AP world options. The intro is always skipped.\r\n- Re-added the AP world options for starting gold and starting with 50 smoke bombs\r\n\r\n### Client\r\n- Ported in fixes from Witchybun\r\n- Fixed a number of bugs related to dialog or cut-scenes softlocking the player when trying to check !collected items. This includes the blob burg chests and the Underworld Leonard battle\r\n- Fixed bugs related to the local data files being overwritten or erased, resulting in players receiving their items multiple times.\r\n- Each save file can connect to a different archipelago server (or no server, i.e. a vanilla game). Each save slot's connection info is saved in its own data file. The game will prompt you to connect to a file's AP server when you go to continue that file\r\n- Added an in-game \"Mod\" options sub-menu to the game's Options menu. In this menu you can configure the following two things:\r\n  - Exp Multiplier, from 1x to 10x experience gain. This is active even when not connected to AP\r\n  - An enable/disable toggle for the pop up notifications that appear when you send or receive items. If disabled, the only notification you'll get when you send or receive items is in the upper-left corner of the screen\r\n \r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a902623-164d-4339-9460-ee017a0d785f)",

Disabled by default\r\n- Added apworld option to add Bard to the monster pool (i.e. they'll be randomized with all other monsters). Disabled by default\r\n- Added apworld option to include the Looter's Handbook custom item (see the bottom of the Client section for details). Enabled by default\r\n- Added apworld option to guarantee that all evolved monsters will drop their catalyst as a battle reward. Disabled by default\r\n- Added apworld options to control how some of the more tedious checks are handled. All of the below checks can be set be vanilla (the checks give their original item and are not randomized), randomized (these locations are randomized with every other location), or filler (the checks will always contain filler items)\r\n  - All four Lady Stasis checks (Dodo Egg) in Snowy Peaks\r\n  - The Old Man by the Sea check (Memorial Ring) in Horizon Beach\r\n  - The Fisherman check (5 Rare Seashells) in Horizon Beach\r\n  - Wanderer's Gift check (for defeating Dracomer) in the Forgotten World\r\n  - Bex's Skorch egg gift in Magma Chamber\r\n  - The Bard egg gift in Forgotten World\r\n  - The Koi egg gift in Sun Palace\r\n-  Re-added all of the Open World apworld options. These options allow you to control how accessible the different regions are. For more details see the yaml documentation in the README.\r\n- Minor logic fixes in the world graph.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Client\r\n- Save files now display the text \"AP\" in the lower-left corner if that save file was created for an archipelago server.\r\n- The client mod now shows its version in the lower-right of the title screen.\r\n- When the client connects to an AP server, it now detects if the client mod and apworld use different versions and will prevent the connection.\r\n- When the client disconnects from the AP server during gameplay, a message box pops up letting the player know they've disconnected and should save and reload the game to reconnect.\r\n- Split the \"Send notifications\" client mod option into four distinct options that control whether a specific type of items shows a popup notification (filler, traps, useful, and progression items).\r\n- When creating a new save file while connected to Archipelago, the dialog to enter the server's hostname now defaults to having \"archipelago.gg:\" entered into the field. This way all you would need to enter is the port number.\r\n- Added a client mod option (which is enabled by default) that makes it so the 'warp to start' menu item will instead warp you to the Keeper Stronghold crystal once you unlock that crystal.\r\n- Added \"Looter's Handbook\" item to the game that can be added to the item pool in the apworld settings. When the player has this item in their inventory, chest sprites will display according to their content: progression items are in purple chests, useful items are in green chests, and filler items are in brown chests. Traps can be in any color chest.",

The area is unlocked by default and contains six new checks, four of which are locked behind defeating each of the spectral familiars.\r\n  - Added new `spectral_familiar_egg_placement` option that controls how the four spectral familiar gift checks are handled. 0 = vanilla item, 1 = randomized, 2 = junk item\r\n- Added a new `automatically_scale_equipment` option. When enabled, weapons and accessories will automatically scale to a level appropriate for the player based on the option's criteria\r\n  - 0, Disabled: Weapons and accessories are not scaled and their level is randomized when the item pool is generated\r\n  - 1, By Level: Weapons and accessories are scaled with the highest level monster the player has\r\n  - 2, By Rank: Weapons and accessories are scaled with the number of champions defeated\r\n  - 3, By Map Progress: Weapons and accessories are scaled with the percentage of the map that is discovered\r\n- Added a new `key_of_power_champion_unlock` option that ranges in value from 0 to 26. When set to a value from 1-26, after the player has defeated that many champions they are given the Key of Power. If set to 0, this option is disabled and the Key of Power is added to the item pool\r\n- Added a new `randomize_monster_skill_trees` option. When enabled, all monster species will have their set of skill trees randomized.\r\n- Added a new `randomize_monster_ultimates` option. When enabled, all monsters species will have their set of three ultimate skills randomized\r\n- Added a new `randomize_monster_shift_skills` option. When enabled, all monster species will have their light and dark shift skills randomized.\r\n\r\n### Client\r\n- When you are prompted to confirm your AP connection information when continuing a save file, if you cancel that confirmation dialog it will allow you to re-enter your connection information.",

You will still get the reward as if you had won the duel.\r\n- Re-added `lock_explore_abilities` option. When enabled, explore abilities are not usable until the player finds an appropriate item (which is randomized into the item pool). There are five different modes for locked explore abilities, summarized thusly:\r\n  - 1: By Type. Each monster is grouped into one of 16 types, and each type has a separate item that unlocks their explore abilities. This is the least restrictive option, as it has the fewest items to unlock everything.\r\n  - 2: By Ability. Each explore ability must be unlocked separately. For example, unlocking Flying will allow that ability to be used on any monster with the Flying ability. This is quite restrictive, as there are around 40 unique items to unlock everything.\r\n  - 3: By Specie. Each monster species will require a unique item to unlock its explore ability (excepting evolutions where the ability doesn't change). This is highly restrictive, with over 100 items to unlock all abilities\r\n  - 4: Progressive. Monster abilities are grouped by function and unlocked progressively. This helps to keep more advanced abilities from being made available early in the game. This is moderately restrictive, as the progressive items will require you to go deeper into a seed before you unlock everything.\r\n  - 5: Combo. Similar to Progression, except there are a smaller number of progressive groups, and more advanced abilities require combinations of different progression chains. For example, using Lofty Mount requires 2x Flying + 1x Mount. This is moderately restrictive, as it is progressive, but there are fewer items than option 4.\r\n\r\n### Client\r\n- Fixed a bug that caused monsters to not drop their default rewards\r\n- When using random skill trees, the RNG is limited such that you should no longer have skill trees that stretch off-screen.\r\n- Added support for locked explore abilities. When selecting a follower, you are disallowed from selecting a follower whose ability you can use. The tooltip for each monster will show how many of what items are required to use a given explore ability.",

Now it also requires either any kind of flying or any kind of ground switch ability.\r\n- Added extra groupings to items:\r\n  - All unique weapons and accessories (yellow-bordered) have the \"Unique\" group.\r\n  - All items have had their classification added as a group (\"Filler\", \"Progression\", \"Useful\", and \"Trap\")\r\n  - All items have had their item type added as a group (\"Key Item\", \"Costume\", \"Crafting Material\", \"Consumable\", \"Food\", \"Catalyst\", \"Weapon\", \"Accessory\", \"Currency\", \"Egg\", and \"Explore Item\")\r\n\r\n### Client\r\n- Fixed some bugs that were preventing loading a save when the game's language set to anything other than English. Non-English languages should now be playable. Though since I don't speak another language I could only do surface-level testing for this. Please report any other issues you find.",

If it were not for them, this update wouldn't have happened. Thanks to them the entire world graph has been updated with a ton of fixes to logic. They were also kind enough to add support for two new options (more about that below).\r\n\r\n### AP World\r\n- So many fixes to inaccurate logic. Too many fixes to name here.\r\n- Added a \"logic_difficulty\" randomizer option (it is at the top of the sample yaml file). This option controls what kind of movement tech the logic expects you to be able to perform, and has three possible values:\r\n  - Casual: Logic will only require of you what the vanilla game expects.\r\n  - Advanced: Logic can require difficult jumps and can require using abilities in unintended ways.\r\n  - Expert: Logic can require frame-perfect (or near frame-perfect) jumps while using abilities in ways they weren't intended.\r\n- Added a \"tedious_checks\" option (it is at the top of the sample yaml file). When enabled (it's disabled by default), the logic will expect the player to use the Warp to Start feature to get out of areas that are only accessible in one direction, or to attempt failed jumps multiple times.\r\n\r\n### Client Mod\r\n- While connected to Archipelago the Monster Journal is revealed by default, and each monster entry lists the regions where that monster can be found.\r\n<img width=\"1764\" height=\"1016\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0a4272b-adf3-47cc-ab62-a513de0aef90\" />\r\n",
