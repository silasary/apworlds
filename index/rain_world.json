Set to vanilla behavior by default.  See [the checks documentation](https://github.com/alphappy/ArchipelagoRW/blob/main/worlds/rain_world/docs/checks_en.md) for details.\r\n  - **Expanded food quest:**  When enabled, the food quest now includes popcorn plants and most creatures (#105).  Like the original food quest, only checks which are possible for the selected slugcat will be generated.  If the *Extreme threats* setting is disabled, certain checks (like Daddy Long Legs) are also not generated.  Disabled by default and requires MSC.  See [the checks documentation](https://github.com/alphappy/ArchipelagoRW/blob/main/worlds/rain_world/docs/checks_en.md) for details.\r\n  - **Sheltersanity:**  When enabled, every shelter is a check (#107).  Disabled by default.\r\n  - **Include Submerged:**  When enabled, checks are generated normally in Submerged Superstructure (#108).  **Disabled by default, except for Rivulet** (previously, Submerged Superstructure generated normally for all slugcats).\r\n- Changed:\r\n  - **Passage progress without Survivor:** Now has the option to bypass Survivor requirement for *all* passages instead of just the 3 normally affected by the Remix setting (#80).  **Bypassing enabled by default.**\r\n  - **Random starting region:** `waterfront_facility`, `undergrowth`, `the_rot`, and `silent_construct` are now valid settings (#94).\r\n  - **Item & location options**: The names of all checks and items have changed to be a bit more readable (#112).  Old names should still work for both the item and location options and for item/location hinting, though they may not work for commands such as `!getitem`.  See [the naming documentation](https://github.com/alphappy/ArchipelagoRW/blob/main/worlds/rain_world/docs/naming_en.md) for details.\r\n\r\n## Logic changes\r\n- Conditional rooms are now properly considered in logic (#89).  Previously, checks in conditional rooms (like the Miros Bird token in `SH_E01RIV`) were never considered accessible.\r\n- Saint's echo in Submerged Superstructure is now a check (#92).\r\n- Echo logic should now be accurate at < 5 karma (#92).\r\n- The Hazers in [LM_E02](https://rain-world-downpour-map.github.io/map.html?slugcat=spear&region=LM&room=LM_E02) (requiring out-of-bounds exploits) and [SL_E02](https://rain-world-downpour-map.github.io/map.html?slugcat=white&region=SL&room=SL_E02) (requiring a jetfish jump or other similarly difficult movement) are no longer considered accessible (#93).\r\n- Meeting Looks to the Moon now requires the Mark (#95).\r\n- Underhang now requires explicit access to a grapple worm to go eastward, which is not guaranteed for vanilla Monk and Survivor worlds without access to Chimney Canopy (#99).\r\n- Westward through Underhang is no longer in logic for Rivulet (#99).\r\n- Subterranean ravine is now correctly considered one-way except for Saint (#104).\r\n- Meeting Five Pebbles now requires the Mark (#106).  Previously it was not required for Sofanthiel, though the plugin still required it to award the check.\r\n- For Hunter, Artificer, and Spearmaster, The Monk and The Saint passages now require access to either a region with abundant popcorn plants - Sky Islands or Farm Arrays - or abundant neuron flies - Five Pebbles or, for Spearmaster, Looks to the Moon (#110).\r\n- The Monk now considers neuron flies in its logic (#110).\r\n- The Hunter is no longer accessible if the only accessible region is Five Pebbles or Submerged Superstructure (#110).\r\n- The Mother is no longer accessible in regions with less than a 20% normal spawn chance (Outskirts, Shoreline, The Exterior, and Outer Expanse) (#110).\r\n- The Waterfront Facility Safari token is no longer accessible to Spearmaster (#113).\r\n\r\n## Other bugfixes\r\n- Singularity bombs should no longer appear in vanilla worlds (#97).\r\n- The Drainage System - Subterranean gate key should now appear in the item pool for all worlds (#100).\r\n- Generation should no longer fail if *glow required for dark places* is enabled and the random starting region is Pipeyard (#101).\r\n- The Nomad should actually use the player YAML setting now (#110).\r\n- \"Access\" and \"Victory\" events should no longer appear in the location list (though they will still appear in the playthrough; #111).\r\n- Locations should no longer be missing from the datapackage (5c57b69).\r\n\r\n**Commit log**: https://github.com/alphappy/ArchipelagoRW/compare/v1.1.1...c8ee7c9",

These default to a v1.10 Survivor world without either DLC enabled.\r\n- `difficulty_extreme_threats` is now an on/off toggle ([#138](https://github.com/alphappy/ArchipelagoRW/pull/138)).  Its function has not changed.  Defaults to off.\r\n\r\n### Generation\r\n- Rivulet worlds should be able to generate again (#124).\r\n\r\n### Logic\r\n- The Subterranean Depths are now properly connected through Filtration System, meaning that the Glow is required to access the Void Sea and Rubicon unless `difficulty_glow` is disabled (#115).\r\n- `GATE_UW_SL` - between Underhang and The Precipice - is now actually in logic and its key may appear in the item pool if MSC is enabled (#124).\r\n\r\n## Minor changes\r\n### Logic\r\n- `VS_S06` ([see map](https://rain-world-downpour-map.github.io/map.html?slugcat=artificer&region=VS&room=VS_S06)), part of Sump Tunnel, is no longer in logic as Artificer (#114).\r\n- `VS_S03` ([see map](https://rain-world-downpour-map.github.io/map.html?slugcat=artificer&region=VS&room=VS_S03)), in the dark part of Pipeyard, is no longer in logic without The Glow (unless `difficulty_glow` is disabled; #114).\r\n- Dandelion Peaches in Outskirts are no longer erroneously accessible for slugcats other than Sofanthiel (#121).  There are likely several other objects affected by this change.\r\n- Glow Weed in Shoreline is no longer erroneously accessible for Sofanthiel (#121).  This means that `checks_submerged` must now be enabled for Sofanthiel to have the Glow Weed food quest check.\r\n- The Scavenger token in `GW_A24` ([see map](https://rain-world-downpour-map.github.io/map.html?slugcat=red&region=GW&room=GW_A24)) is no longer erroneously accessible for Hunter (#122).\r\n- The Red Lizard token in `GW_A14` ([see map](https://rain-world-downpour-map.github.io/map.html?slugcat=red&region=GW&room=GW_A14)) is no longer in logic without access to Bubble Weed (#123).\r\n- The Broken Precipice is now correctly considered its own separate region - this includes `SL_S13` ([see map](https://rain-world-downpour-map.github.io/map.html?slugcat=white&region=SL&room=SL_S13)) for sheltersanity, which needs `GATE_UW_SL` to access (#124, #137).\r\n- Shoreline above the puppet room (`SL_AI`) is now correctly considered its own subregion - this includes `SL_STOP` ([see map](https://rain-world-downpour-map.github.io/map.html?slugcat=white&region=SL&room=SL_STOP)) for sheltersanity, which requires either playing as Saint or coming from Bitter Aerie as Rivulet (#124).\r\n- Shoreline above the puppet room no longer generates at all for most slugcats, and only generates for Rivulet if `checks_submerged` is enabled (#124).  It will still always generate for Saint.\r\n- The gates in The Exterior are now properly connected to their appropriate subregions, so the spoiler paths which go through The Exterior should make more sense now (#137).\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/alphappy/ArchipelagoRW/compare/v1.2.0...v1.2.3",

This should improve generation times, especially for larger multiworlds (at the very least, unit tests are taking half as long).  This also slightly changes how the spoiler log shows event access in the `Paths` section.\r\n  - Logic for most Passage and Food Quest checks depends on events which indicate where a particular creature or object may be found.  Previously, an event existed in each region for each creature or object of interest that was there, resulting in several hundred events per world.  There is now only one central event for each creature or object of interest.\r\n- Spitter Spider traps are now actually added to the pool (#176).\r\n- Setting `passage_progress_without_survivor` to `disabled` or `enabled` should no longer fail generation (#178).\r\n- Pearl checks no longer generate for Monk without MSC enabled (#182).\r\n\r\n## Minor changes\r\n### Player YAML settings\r\n- `which_game_version` now explicitly supports up to 1.10.4 (#165).  `1_10_1` is still a valid value and is equivalent to `1_10_4`.\r\n- `passage_priority` should actually work again (#178).\r\n\r\n### Logic\r\n- The Scholar is no longer incorrectly accessible to Rivulet and Hunter without the Mark (#150).\r\n- Drainage System to Subterranean is now properly considered a dark connection and won't be in logic without The Glow unless `difficulty_glow` is disabled (#151).\r\n- Rivulet's \"Longer cycles\" item is now properly considered progression since it is required to enter Submerged Superstructure if `difficulty_submerged` is enabled (#152).\r\n- `MS_S04` is no longer considered accessible to Monk and inaccessible to Rivulet (#173).\r\n- `OFFSCREEN` rooms should now be properly considered for logic which depends on access to creatures such as the food quest (#174).\r\n\r\n### Generation\r\n- A more descriptive error is given when setting all filler or trap weights to zero (#167).\r\n- Default trap weights have been adjusted (#176).\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n- Passage tokens now belong to the `Passage Token` hint group (#148).\r\n- Gate keys now belong to two hint groups each - one for each region they connect (#148).\r\n- `difficulty_glow` is no longer implemented as a fake item, which should prevent some weird behavior in edge cases from external trackers like UT (#169).\r\n- `debug_output` added as a hidden player YAML setting (#172).  This prints the slot data and client mappings for item and location names to extra files in the output ZIP.\r\n- Static data now uses bitflags instead of sets of strings to represent slugcat accessibility (#175).  This reduces the filesize of the APWorld by a bit and should make future commits which affect the static data cleaner.\r\n- `difficulty_glow`, `difficulty_monk`, `difficulty_hunter`, `difficulty_outlaw`, `difficulty_chieftain`, `difficulty_nomad`, and `checks_submerged` are now transmitted through slot data (#177).\r\n\r\nFull commit log: https://github.com/alphappy/ArchipelagoRW/compare/v1.2.3.1...v1.2.8",

This also slightly changes how the spoiler log shows event access in the `Paths` section.\r\n  - Logic for most Passage and Food Quest checks depends on events which indicate where a particular creature or object may be found.  Previously, an event existed in each region for each creature or object of interest that was there, resulting in several hundred events per world.  There is now only one central event for each creature or object of interest.\r\n- Spitter Spider traps are now actually added to the pool (#176).\r\n- Setting `passage_progress_without_survivor` to `disabled` or `enabled` should no longer fail generation (#178).\r\n- Pearl checks no longer generate for Monk without MSC enabled (#182).\r\n\r\n## Minor changes\r\n### Player YAML settings\r\n- `which_game_version` now explicitly supports up to 1.10.4 (#165).  `1_10_1` is still a valid value and is equivalent to `1_10_4`.\r\n- `passage_priority` should actually work again (#178).\r\n\r\n### Logic\r\n- The Scholar is no longer incorrectly accessible to Rivulet and Hunter without the Mark (#150).\r\n- Drainage System to Subterranean is now properly considered a dark connection and won't be in logic without The Glow unless `difficulty_glow` is disabled (#151).\r\n- Rivulet's \"Longer cycles\" item is now properly considered progression since it is required to enter Submerged Superstructure if `difficulty_submerged` is enabled (#152).\r\n- `MS_S04` is no longer considered accessible to Monk and inaccessible to Rivulet (#173).\r\n- `OFFSCREEN` rooms should now be properly considered for logic which depends on access to creatures such as the food quest (#174).\r\n\r\n### Generation\r\n- A more descriptive error is given when setting all filler or trap weights to zero (#167).\r\n- Default trap weights have been adjusted (#176).\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n- Passage tokens now belong to the `Passage Token` hint group (#148).\r\n- Gate keys now belong to two hint groups each - one for each region they connect (#148).\r\n- `difficulty_glow` is no longer implemented as a fake item, which should prevent some weird behavior in edge cases from external trackers like UT (#169).\r\n- `debug_output` added as a hidden player YAML setting (#172).  This prints the slot data and client mappings for item and location names to extra files in the output ZIP.\r\n- Static data now uses bitflags instead of sets of strings to represent slugcat accessibility (#175).  This reduces the filesize of the APWorld by a bit and should make future commits which affect the static data cleaner.\r\n- `difficulty_glow`, `difficulty_monk`, `difficulty_hunter`, `difficulty_outlaw`, `difficulty_chieftain`, `difficulty_nomad`, and `checks_submerged` are now transmitted through slot data (#177).\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/alphappy/ArchipelagoRW/compare/v1.2.3.1...v1.3.0",

Watcher is not considered stable yet, so I would **not** recommend playing as Watcher in public games unless your host is aware of this and is willing to release checks in the case of logic errors.\r\n\r\nThe Watcher features are too long to list here, you can find documentation on how the campaign and its related settings work here: [Watcher Documentation](https://github.com/alphappy/ArchipelagoRW/blob/1.5/worlds/rain_world/docs/watcher_en.md). \r\nThe following change log will detail new features and fixes that impact non-Watcher slugcats.\r\n\r\n### Player YAML Settings\r\n- `random_starting_region` option changed into `randomize_starting_region` and `possible_starting_regions`. Selecting starting regions is basically the same process, except it no longer relies on the yaml weighting system and will automatically not consider regions that are invalid for the current options. (#262)\r\n- `difficulty_submerged` updated to enable making the Aquatic Perk required for access to Submerged Superstructure. (#246)\r\n- `checks_submerged` updated to enable conditional generation of Submerged Superstructure based on the Aquatic Perk's presence in the item pool. (#246)\r\n\r\n### Logic Changes\r\n\r\n- Some story ending victory conditions changed to more accurately reflect reality. (#250)\r\n  - Spearmaster now only logically requires their pearl and Look to the Moon's message.\r\n  - Gourmand and Artificer no longer logically require access to Five Pebbles.\r\n- Fixed dev tokens in SI_A17 and SI_A18 being generated for slugcats other than Saint. (#247)\r\n- Fix a data error causing certain rooms to not generate their checks (Notably GW_D01_PAST). (#247)\r\n- Rivulet will now not generate the last Wanderer pip or the Wanderer passage if Submerged Superstructure generation is disabled. (#246)\r\n- SL_C15 and below is now considered \"part\" of Submerged Superstructure when it comes to check generation. (#246)\r\n- The SB_ravine pearl will no longer generate for Artificer or Spearmaster, as it is not longer present there as of 1.11.6. (2150a1f8baa9d593473d27bff759e495624e36f9)\r\n\r\n### Other Fixes\r\n- YAML creation menus should no longer show an empty \"Game Options\" category",
