      "description": "Duke Nukem 3D Randomizer for Archipelago\r\n========================================\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\n* Get latest engine binary release from https://github.com/LLCoolDave/NBloodAP/releases (rednukemAP.exe) (64bit Windows only for now)\r\n* Get DUKE3DAP.zip, DUKE3DAP.grpinfo from below and put them in the same directory as rednukemAP.exe\r\n* Get the matching duke3d.apworld from below as well and place it in your Archipelago `lib/worlds` directory.\r\n  * Make sure the DUKE3DAP.zip you use matches the duke3d.apworld used to generate a seed or the client will not connect\r\n* This randomizer requires a duke3d.grp and DUKE.RTS from the **1.5 Atomic Edition** release of Duke Nukem 3D\r\n  * This is the most common distribution of the classic game and bundled with almost all digital release of the past two decades\r\n  * The World Tour 20th Anniversary release is **not** supported\r\n  * duke3d.grp should have SHA1 hash `4fdef8559e2d35b1727fe92f021df9c148cf696c` and MD5 hash `22b6938fe767e5cc57d1fe13080cd522`\r\n  * Rednukem generally detects the files in most installation directories of common distributions of the game. If the auto detection\r\n    does not detect your files, copy them into the same directory as rednukemAP.exe\r\n* This APWorld requires Archipelago 0.4.4!\r\n\r\nIf all dependencies are detected correctly, a single game of `Duke Nukem 3D Randomizer for Archipelago` should be selectable\r\nin the rednukemAP.exe launcher window\r\n\r\nSimply enter your connection details and enjoy!\r\n\r\nHow the randomizer works\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nAll weapon and inventory pickups have been converted into AP locations. If enabled, secret sectors also get converted to locations.\r\n\r\nUnlockable items are weapons, ammunition capacity, inventory items and one time buffs.\r\nIf enabled, the ability to jump, crouch, sprint and dive into water have to be unlocked. This is a fun new way to explore the familiar levels.\r\nIf diving is unlockable, Duke can only submerge into water while he has scuba gear capacity remaining.\r\n\r\nProgression inventory items are restored on every level entry. The logic is designed so that locations can be checked from the start\r\nof a level with the unlocked capacity thresholds, but not necessarily all locations can be checked in a single go. Simply restart a level to try again.\r\n\r\nIf enabled, saving and loading is enabled. This preserves the level, but **not** player state to be resumed later. For the purposes of inventory management,\r\nloading a previously saved game functions as a new level entry, just at an intermediate state.\r\n\r\nSpecial Thanks\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n* The Rednukem team for providing an open source, faithful source port of Duke Nukem 3D to use as a baseline\r\n* Daivuk for creating [apdoom](https://github.com/Daivuk/apdoom/tree/heretic) and the animated Archipelago sprites I shamelessly reused.\r\n* rand0 for supporting me in alpha testing and creating the logic rules for episode 4\r\n* oasiz for being the resident build engine wizzard\r\n",

      "description": "- Add **Open** and **Use** abilities\r\n  - These are controlled by the optional _unlock_interact_ setting and are disabled by default (for now)\r\n  - _Open_ refers to the ability to directly interact with level geometry. This includes all types of doors, but also elevators and other similar interactbales\r\n  - _Use_ refers to the ability to interact with buttons and switches that change the world state, such as key card slots or other switches.\r\n    - Shootable switches are still interactable by shooting them with any weapon, such as the starter pistol, even if _Use_ has not been unlocked yet\r\n- Added location density setting _location_density_ to control the amount of checks per map\r\n  - Includes 5 different density settings. **iconic**, **balanced**, **dense**, **all** and **include_mp_only_pickups**\r\n  - **include_mp_only_pickups** replaces previous _include_mp_items_ setting\r\n  - All pickup locations are placed into different density categories. Selecting a specific density level includes all pickups of this and all prior levels\r\n  - The goal is to give some control over the density of checks, as some Duke3D maps have a lot of checks relative to other AP games. This allows you to balance check density dynamically with other games in a multiplayer AP world.\r\n  - The default **balanced** setting is a proposed density level of checks that feels roughly on par with other AP games, offering interesting pickups for access restricted areas in maps without flooding players with rewards\r\n  - **balanced** density tends to include one item pickup per secret area where applicable\r\n- Some minor rebalances of fille item pools for different difficulties. Added some stronger variations of atomic health rewards at lower difficulty ratings.\r\n- Tons of logic fixes and adaptations, especially for more glitched logic and higher logic difficulty tricks\r\n- Increased compatibility with the universal tracker. This might still have issues correctly picking up unlocked levels, though,",
