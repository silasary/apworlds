Cannot reduce it much further without the game acting up, so probably going to leave it here.\r\n- Items are now resynced upon loading a game (either starting a new one or reloading a save file).\r\n- Locations that you did already in the multiworld are automatically marked as done upon loading a game.\r\n  NOTE: I have not figured out yet how to get rid of the popup for granting technologies, so if you have done 60 techs already, be prepared to click a lot.\r\n- All AP techs now have a (somewhat badly scaled) AP icon instead of the Agriculture icon. I will replace it with a proper icon later, but I really wanted to get rid of the Agriculture icon.\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/1313e/Civ-V-AP-World/compare/v0.2.0...v0.2.1",

These items appear in the tech tree as disabled technologies, meaning that you cannot research them yourself. They can only be unlocked by outside influence. As disabled technologies are red, it is also easy to see up to what era is unlocked now.\r\n- All technologies are now isolated within their own era. Requirements of technologies based on previous eras no longer exist (but they do within the era itself).\r\n  So, for example, if in vanilla a Classical tech requires an Ancient tech, their AP counterparts will not.\r\n  However, if in vanilla an Ancient tech requires an earlier Ancient tech, then their AP counterparts do as well.\r\n- The above means that AP techs can be researched out of order if you so wish, assuming you have the proper era unlocked. This was done on purpose to make it much less of a hassle to check a location (tech in this case) that someone for example hinted.\r\n- 7 new AP technologies were added to the location pool (one for each era that is not Information) to make up for the 7 added progressive eras. They have the same cost as the first tech normally in that era. These might be removed later on when I have added more location types.\r\n- A new option was added to the YAML where you can specify which era must be unlocked before the game is considered beatable. Default is Information Era (receive all 7 Progressive Era items).\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/1313e/Civ-V-AP-World/compare/v0.2.1...v0.3.0",

Note that this only affects logic. The game itself does not block you from checking those locations.\r\n- Added the \"Embarking Goal Logic\" option. When set to True, the technologies Optics (enables embarking) and Astronomy (enables ocean embarking) are logically required to beat the game. Similarly to the above, this only affects logic.\r\n- The \"Progressive Exploration\" item has been renamed to \"Progressive Navy\", which now contains 9 technologies instead of the 4 it used to have. The first 4 are exploration (over water) related; whereas the other 5 unlock naval units.\r\n- Added a new filler item named \"Snack from Thes\". This item gives you 200 Gold; 200 Culture; and 100 Faith. Unlike all other items in the game, this one breaks naming convention and instead is named after my sister, who requested an item to be named after her. It has a higher chance of appearing compared to other filler items of the same value.\r\n- Added an overview of all logic related rules that are hidden in the APWorld to the README, including the changes made in this release.\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/1313e/Civ-V-AP-World/compare/v0.6.4...v0.7.1",

      "description": "NOTE: Several new options were added, so the YAML template needs to be regenerated.\r\nNOTE2: The AP Mod is no longer needed as this release creates its own mod versions. Please remove the old AP Mod from Civ V.\r\n\r\n**General**:\r\n- Patch files with slot-specific mod versions\r\n- Item hints\r\n\r\n**Changes/Improvements**:\r\n- Manifest file was added for compatibility with AP 0.7+\r\n- `items.py` and `locations.py` were split into proper subpackages. This improves maintainability and readability.\r\n- Cleaned up the way progressive items are defined, heavily reducing code complexity.\r\n  - Progression items can now define that they belong to a progressive item (like how technologies are also part of a progressive technology).\r\n  - Progressive items can now define that they should be used under specific circumstances, like an option being toggled on.\r\n  - Progression items are only included in the item pool if none of their progressive parents are included. Each progression item can still only be included in the pool once this way.\r\n  - Item requirements now only have to specify a progression item as their requirement. If they belong to a progressive item, the item requirements access rule will automatically take that into account now.\r\n- The APWorld now generates an output/patch file when generating a seed:\r\n  - This patch file contains a version of the AP Mod unique to this slot.\r\n  - When playing on a specific seed, all you need to do now is open the patch file belonging to that seed. The file takes care of everything else, like installing that mod; opening the Civ V Client; connecting to the correct server; etc.\r\n  - Once in Civ V, enable the mod that was installed for you and you can start playing your slot.\r\n- With the new slot-specific mod versions, also enabled the following features:\r\n  - Policy and technology costs can now be modified in the YAML.\r\n  - Locations can now have hints what item it will send.\r\n  - Loading a save file or mod not related to the connected slot will now stop the client from working. This avoids sending checks by accident from unrelated save files; or enabling an AP Mod version from a different slot.\r\n\r\n**Fixes**:\r\n- Policy cost modifier is now applied to the Palace instead of each policy. This should fix the issue with culture (costs) underflowing.\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/1313e/Civ-V-AP-World/compare/v0.7.1...v0.8.0",
