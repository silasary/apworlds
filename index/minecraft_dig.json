(Needs Minecraft 1.19.4 instead of 1.20.4).\r\nThanks to [Ashindigo](<https://github.com/AshIndigo/Minecraft_AP_Randomizer/releases/tag/dig-v0.0.2-hotfix>) for updating the mod.\r\n\r\n# MinecraftAP step by step:\r\n> 0. If you're on an old Archipelago install, would recommend installing the [latest stable](<https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases/latest>) version (0.6.5) with \"clean libs\" ticked on.\r\n> 1. Install the [minecraft.apworld](https://github.com/jacobmix/Minecraft_AP_Randomizer/releases/latest/download/minecraft.apworld) hotfix (double click it), restart AP, and Generate Template Options.\r\n> 2. Use Option Creator in the launcher to create your Minecraft player yaml (or edit it manually with a text editor like [Notepad++](<https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/>))\r\n>   - Give yaml to host or put yaml(s) in the ``Players`` folder, and press \"Generate\" to get a multiworld ``.zip`` in the ``output`` folder (Terminal window will close if gen successful)\r\n>   - Host by uploading to the [site](<https://archipelago.gg/uploads>).\r\n>      - Only need one Minecraft yaml. Multiple players can join the same mc server/slot. Can have more Minecraft yamls/slots but they won't run on the same server.\r\n> 3. Get ``.apmc`` patch file from room/host/extracted multiworld zip.\r\n> 4. Launch specifically ``ArchipelagoLauncherDebug.exe`` from the Archipelago directory. (Don't worry about the command terminal yet)\r\n>   - Linux: To run \"Debug\" open terminal in Archipelago folder, run ``./ArchipelagoLauncher`` (or the ``appimage``)\r\n> 5. Open the Minecraft client (from the normal Archipelago window from launching debug)\r\n> 6. Client should ask for ``.apmc`` file. Point it to the one received from host/room/zip.\r\n> 7. In the terminal that opened when you ran the ``ArchipelagoLauncherDebug.exe``, there will be prompts to install Java, Forge, and the randomizer hotfix (assuming none were installed). Say yes to all three.\r\n> 8. Manually open [Minecraft Java Edition](<https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-edition>) (v1.20.4), go to ``Multiplayer > Direct Connection``, and join ``localhost`` server address. (Or IP of player running Minecraft Forge Server with ``.apmc``)\r\n>   - if you want other players to join your slot. You need to port forward the port, and allow the forge sever through your firewall. Minecraft Forge Server port by default is ``25565``\r\n> 9. When in-game, you will need to connect manually using ``/connect <IP> <PORT> <PASS>`` Example: ``/connect archipelago.gg 38281 CoolestPassword``\r\n>   - You don't need to set pass if not used.  Also do: ``/start``\r\nMore info in [original setup doc](<https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/blob/0.6.1/worlds/minecraft/docs/minecraft_en.md>)\r\nHow the rando works: <https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/blob/d8576e72eb609cb9d779fe59f4243e3dd8afb9aa/worlds/minecraft/docs/en_Minecraft.md>\r\nYou can check unlocks in the advancement \"received items\" menu.\r\nTracker: <https://github.com/Cyb3RGER/minecraft_rando_tracker>\r\n\r\nBonus apworlds (require ap restart):\r\n> - Update apworlds: <https://github.com/silasary/Archipelago/releases?q=Manager>\r\n> - Track what is in-logic: <https://github.com/FarisTheAncient/Archipelago/releases?q=Tracker>\r\nShow file extensions: <https://www.howtogeek.com/205086/beginner-how-to-make-windows-show-file-extensions/>\r\n\r\nTip: You can connect with just one string in the top of any text based client by putting your info in the top bar like this, and pressing enter:\r\n> ``<SLOT_NAME>:None@<IP/URL>:<PORT>``\r\n> Example: ``CoolPlayer:CoolerPassword@archipelago.gg:38281``\r\n``None`` just works with no pass set. But you can also leave it empty: ``CoolPlayer:@``, either works.\r\nHosting locally on the same machine just use ``localhost`` for the IP. Localhost also doesn't need a port.\r\n\r\nFirewall/port:\r\n> - Allow Forge Server through firewall\r\n>   - Open: ``control.exe`` (Searching in Windows)\r\n>   - ``Control Panel\\All Control Panel Items\\Windows Defender Firewall\\Allowed apps``>``Change Settings (Admin)``>``Allow another app...``>``Browse...``>``Forge-x.jar`` >``Add``>``Allow apps``\r\n> - Can PortForward with [this](<https://gist.github.com/jacobmix/ed6a0dcf3188f4843e414099fdd63cc4>)\r\n\r\nTip: Can use [MultiMC](<https://multimc.org/>) to create a shortcut for Minecraft v1.20.4. Even set it to auto connect to localhost\r\nYou can also set ``.apmc`` file to be opened with Archipelago, and if you double click it then it'll instantly start the forge server for you.\r\nCheck ``host.yaml`` (in the Archipelago install directory) for ``mc_launch`` to auto start Minecraft after the Forge Server.\r\n\r\nTo host a multiworld without auto collect enabled, open ``host.yaml`` with a text editor like Notepad++\r\nChange ``collect_mode`` setting from ``auto`` to ``disabled``. Or ``goal`` to allow manual collect. Then generate a multiworld.\r\nOther settings too. Like release mode, hint options, server password for remote admin commands, ect.\r\nPlando players might also want host to edit ``plando_options`` to ``bosses, items, texts, connections``\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n> It is highly recommended to use the Archipelago installer to handle the installation of the forge server for you. Support will not be given for those wishing to manually install forge.\r\n> Will also not help with using other mods besides AP. Tho will say both client & server probably needs the same mods. Server mods usually at: ``C:\\ProgramData\\Archipelago\\Minecraft Forge server\\mods``\r\n## Troubleshooting:\r\nIf an item didn't get sent. Check if it's location is collected on the sever end, by looking at the room tracker page.\r\nCould have been collected from another game goaling, and collecting it's items from other games.\r\nElse host can manually send the location with this [command](<https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/commands_en>): ``/send_location <player name> <location name>``\r\nOr you type: ``/op <Minecraft Username>`` in forge server terminal. Then in-game: ``/advancement (grant|revoke) @a only <advancement>``\r\n[Example](<https://minecraft.wiki/w/Commands/advancement>): ``/advancement grant @a only aprandomizer:archipelago/get_wood``\r\nAlso: https://discord.com/channels/731205301247803413/1331798503898222662\r\n\r\n ``No dataPackage found`` that's fine. It's an expected message, and you won't get a message when one has been made.\r\n\r\nConnect command don't work: You need to be on the server. Direct connect to ``localhost``.\r\n\r\n``IncompatibleVersion`` check you're on Minecraft version 1.20.4.\r\n\r\nLinux: ``IllegalArgumentException``\r\nInstall Java 17 <https://github.com/corretto/corretto-17/releases/latest>\r\nAdd to ``host.yaml``:\r\n```yaml\r\nminecraft_options:\r\n  java: \"/home/<user>/.local/share/Archipelago/jdk17.0.17_10/bin/java\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n``missing/not found win_args``, ``wrong/no .apmc``, ``UnicodeDecodeError``, ``getsockopt``, ``Module 'world.minecraft' has no attribute`` or forge server crashing: Delete ``Minecraft Forge server`` and redo setup.\r\nUpdate Archipelago launcher, get latest hotfix apworld from pins, restart AP, Generate Template Options, install forge server with debug, and run the proper ``.apmc`` file with Archipelago/Client.\r\nBackup ``APData`` & ``Archipelago-#-X``.\r\n\r\nIf you see in your forge server logs: ``java.io.IOException: The process cannot access the file``\r\nSomething might be blocking files. If you're syncing the Archipelago folder with OneDrive disable that.\r\nMay also be you're running a forge server already. Close it. Else it could be your anti-virus:\r\n> - Windows default anti-virus: Search (Windows Key+S): \"Windows Security\", and open it.\r\n>   - Virus & threat protection>Protection history>Click newest top one>ADMIN prompt: Yes>See if \"Affected items\" is anything Archipelago/Minecraft related. If so follow this next step:\r\n>   - Virus/protection>Manage settings>Add or remove exclusions>ADMIN prompt: Yes>Add an exclusion>Folder>\"Archipelago, Minecraft, and patch location directories\"\r\n\r\nAlso check files aren't encrypted:\r\n> You can right click folder>properties to check if it's being encrypted.

If so follow this next step:\r\n>   - Virus/protection>Manage settings>Add or remove exclusions>ADMIN prompt: Yes>Add an exclusion>Folder>\"Archipelago, Minecraft, and patch location directories\"\r\n\r\nAlso check files aren't encrypted:\r\n> You can right click folder>properties to check if it's being encrypted.
