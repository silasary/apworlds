Requires some investigation on my end.\r\n* Blocks aren't collected\r\n\t* Collect may have additional issues, I don't use `!collect` in games. Feels bad. May fix at some point...?\r\n* Star Blocks aren't properly colored to match their contents\r\n* There are some entity-entity priority issues in the overworld map and the Bowser fight\r\n* There _may_ be some areas that have weird graphics or \"invisible\" enemies/entities or even impossible setups. Please report them alongside your seed to see how to work around those on my end. (This is Enemy Shuffle exclusive)\r\n* The Mario in the map border will animate in response to the D-Pad inputs if ice physics were present in the last level the player entered\r\n* Some things may get cut with incoming messages. Will be fixed later once deciding what's the best course of action to fix the issue\r\n* P-Switch/Star music may keep playing after entering a door. Will cause a audio driver crash on certain emulators, requires investigating further for finding the actual trigger, any kind of detailed report will help to find the cause.\r\n* Morton Castle may disconnect on hitting Vine Block #1 (requires investigating, will appreciate detailed reports)\r\n* Donut Secret 2 may disconnect on hitting Directional Coin Block #1 (requires investigating, will appreciate detailed reports)\r\n* Donut Plains 4 sends a powerup block check immediately",
