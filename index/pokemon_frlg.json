This adds location checks that trigger by entering the map that would normally grant the ability to fly to that map\r\n- New Option: Starting Money - Allows you to set the amount of money you want to start the game with\r\n- New Option: Town Map Fly Location - Unlocks a random fly destination once the town map is obtained\r\n- New Option: Kanto Only - Only locations/items from Kanto will be accessible. The Sevii Islands will not be accessible at all in the playthrough\r\n- Updated various location, region, and entrance names for better clarity in the spoiler log\r\n- Added free fly and town map fly locations to the settings area of the spoiler log\r\n- Unique items that are in your start inventory (Badges, HMs, Key Items, etc.) will be removed from the itempool\r\n- Restored the forced story warps that were removed. The NPCs that trigger these warps will not disappear from those locations, and you can take the warp again by talking to them. These are as follows: Pok\u00e9mon Tower 7F - Mr. Fuji, Berry Forest - Lostelle, Lost Cave Room 10 - Selphy, Cinnabar Island Pok\u00e9mon Center - Bill\r\n- Adding to the last point. Bill at Cinnabar Island will no longer give the Tri Pass check. Talking to him at the Pok\u00e9mon Center will take you to One Island. Celio will give you the Tri Pass check during your first meeting on One Island as in the vanilla game\r\n- Removed the pointless Rival dialog that happens on Four & Six Island\r\n- Removed the dungeon splash art screen that appears when entering a dungeon",

      "description": "[Setup Guide](https://github.com/vyneras/Archipelago/blob/0.7.0-beta/worlds/pokemon_frlg/docs/setup_en.md)\r\n[Rom Changes](https://github.com/vyneras/Archipelago/blob/0.7.0-beta/worlds/pokemon_frlg/docs/rom%20changes.md)\r\n\r\n**Updates**\r\n- New Option: Goal - Allows you to set whether your goal is defeat the Elite Four or defeat the Elite Four rematch. The Elite Four rematch is accessible after you beat the Elite Four the first time and have restored the network machine on Sevii\r\n- New Option: Famesanity - Unlocking entries in the Fame Checker gives you an item. All entries that are one time only are able to be triggered repeatedly \r\n- New Option: Pok\u00e9mon Request Locations - Shuffles locations that require you to show a specific Pok\u00e9mon to an NPC. Talking to the NPC who wants to see the Pok\u00e9mon will provide the dex info for where to find it as well as tell you what item they will give\r\n- New Option: Silph Co. Card Key - Sets how the card key for Silph Co. is handled (vanilla, split, progressive)\r\n- New Option: Sevii Island Passes - Sets how the island passes are handled (vanilla, progressive, split, split + progressive)\r\n- Updated Option: Flash Required - Added new option that requires you to have flash to go through dark caves. You will be allowed to enter the dark cave but trying to go any further in without being able to use Flash will force you out of the cave\r\n- New Option: Fame Checker Required - Sets whether the Fame Checker is required to unlock entries\r\n- New Option: Modify World State - Allows you to specify a number of modifications to places in the world that will affect logic\r\n- New Option: Additional Dark Caves - Allows you to specify additional caves to be dark caves and potentially require flash to navigate\r\n- Removed Option: Cerulean Roadblocks - Has been added to the new Modify World State option\r\n- Updated Option: Level Scaling - Added an option to scale levels by both spheres and distance from Pallet Town\r\n- Some locations have had their names updated. A number of NPCs are starting to have multiple checks based on settings and this is to better distinguish them\r\n- Locations that are locked behind your goal will automatically be excluded\r\n- Oak will now give you the Mystic Ticket and Aurora Ticket check in the Hall of Fame after beating the Champion\r\n- Vs. Seeker's capability has been restored, and you can now rematch trainers. Locations that require you to spend money now logically require a way to grind money\r\n- The NPCs and hidden items in the Celadon Game Corner that give coins are now randomized. Coins can now show up as filler items\r\n- Starting items are now placed directly into your bag at the start of the game instead of into your PC\r\n- The Sevii Island quest has had some alterations. The Rocket Warehouse now requires you to learn both passwords to enter. You can no longer give the Sapphire to Celio until you have saved the captured Pok\u00e9mon in the Rocket Warehouse (defeated the 2nd Team Rocket Admin)\r\n- You can no longer go down waterfalls unless you are able to use the HM\r\n- Restored the dungeon splash screens. Turns out they aren't actually that problematic. Might make this a cosmetic option later but for now too minor of a thing for me to bother with\r\n- You can now decline the first warp from Mr. Fuji, and he will move out of the way so you can grab the hidden item under him first",

Check out the ROM changes documentation for more info\r\n- The evolution fanfare can now be randomized to the Pok\u00e9 Flute fanfare.

This fixes a soft lock that could occur when using GO HOME on Cycling Road\r\n- The first Rival battle in Oak's Lab has had the tutorial flag removed. This fixes some weird behavior that could occur when you fought him with multiple Pok\u00e9mon\r\n- Fixed an issue where if a gift Pok\u00e9mon was sent to your PC, the following textboxes would use the Box's name instead of the Pok\u00e9mon's name\r\n- Adding Cacophony to the `ability_blacklist` should no longer cause generation failures.\r\n- `modify_trainer_levels` will no longer be applied twice when using a Revision 1.1 ROM",
