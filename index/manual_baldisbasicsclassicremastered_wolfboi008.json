  "description": "Manual games allow you to set custom check locations and custom item names that will be rolled into a multiworld.\nThis allows any variety of game -- PC, console, board games, Microsoft Word memes... really anything -- to be part of a multiworld randomizer.\nThe key component to including these games is some level of manual restriction. Since the items are not actually withheld from the player,\nthe player must manually refrain from using these gathered items until the tracker shows that they have been acquired or sent.",

It's still plando'd because that's the only thing I could do to prevent solo generation failure.\r\n- **Added a Classic Style Pass to compliment the previous major change further, allowing for the potential of any Style being the first one unlocked.**\r\n- **Added an option to pick the Style you want unlocked at the beginning.** (Special thanks to @FuzzyGamesOn in the Manual Discord Server for helping my simple ass learn how to do this)\r\n- **Added Regions.**\r\n- **Added descriptions for goal conditions, including a simplified guide for the NULL goal.**\r\n- Added DeathLink.",

For some reason, there was a consistent discrepancy with the Items, allowing for issues that could've appeared in some particular circumstances.\r\n  - **One of the big changes is to how Progressive Notebooks unlocked Checks. Now, you can access the first two Notebooks for free, and you can almost complete a whole run of Classic, Party, or Demo with 2 of their respective Notebooks (and the matching Pass, of course).**\r\n    - Progress will still be halted when you get to the 7th Notebook Check, as you still need the 7 Notebooks and the 4 Exits to progress further.\r\n\r\nI think that's all of the changes, unless I'm forgetting something.",
