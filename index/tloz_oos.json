These are transmitted to the server once read\r\n- Gasha nut kill requirement can now be set between 0 and 250 (wearing a gasha ring still doubles the progress towards the chosen number)\r\n    - The default number of required kills has been decreased to 20, you can set it back to vanilla in your yaml\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Bugfixes\r\n- Fixed rupee packs being bad and progression if the rupee old men give enough rupees\r\n- Now handle properly all characters for the name of other players/items\r\n- Fixed Warp to Start working while gathering a gasha nut which leads to issues (now you need to be on the ground and not having an animation happen to be able to warp to start)\r\n- Fixed Start Inventory causing some interactions to not work\r\n\r\n## \ud83e\udde0 Logic\r\n- Using the iframes to walk through spikes is now in medium logic\r\n- Added going from the d6 sector to lost woods to the logic\r\n- Added dimitri clipping to hell logic\r\n- Fixed a logic issue where Golden Lynel could be in logic without owning a season other than winter, coming from the tarm gate\r\n- Fixed logic not considering the snow piles in lost woods blocking access to the phonograph deku, if coming from d6, the combination happens to be all winters and base season is winter\r\n- Using mysteries is now in medium logic against the beetles and hardhats. Also 2 satchel are now required to be consistent with all the other fighting requirements\r\n- Hell logic now consider the bomb jump in d7 to access the magunesu chest\r\n- Added a new route to use Dimitri in winter to get to d5 using default lake's autumn\r\n\r\n## \u23eb Miscellaneous Improvements\r\n- Removed the stairs added by the rando to prevent softlocks in summer eyeglass island and put back the one going to deep woods (accounted for only in hard+ logic)\r\n- Added autotracking support for the dekus\r\n- Added the essences and jewels item groups\r\n- Reworked item classifications:\r\n    - Small Keys, D0's master key, Bombs, currency and trade items cannot be found in priority locations\r\n    - Barren dungeon's map and compasses are now fillers and free to go out of their dungeon if their keysanity is enabled (they could be shown as useful in the future if that is desired)\r\n- Changed few texts",

      "description": "## \ud83e\udd47 Main Features\r\n\r\n- **The patcher is now integrated inside the APWorld!**\r\n    - This means you no longer have to download an external patcher, the APWorld does everything\r\n    - The person who generates gives you an `.apoos` patch, just grab the same APWorld as the server and you can use that patch file to create your ROM through the Archipelago Launcher\r\n    - Everything was rewritten basically, allowing for lots of improvements in all aspects\r\n\r\n- **Quick season switching**\r\n    - When using the rod to change a season, you now have a way to choose which season you want to summon instead of cycling through all seasons\r\n    - Right after using the rod (or at the same time if you buffer out of a menu), hold the diagonal on the D-Pad which points to the icon of the season you want to summon (you can look at the top bar to see the icon layout when the rod is equipped)\r\n    - If you hold no specific button, seasons cycle the same way they\u2019ve always done\r\n\r\n- **Options rework**\r\n    - \ud83d\uded1 **Please re-create your YAML option files from scratch, since many options changed names / values**\r\n    - Many two-values options (\u201dvanilla / randomized\u201d) are now toggles (\u201dtrue / false\u201d) which are better presented on the options webpage\r\n    - Many options were moved over to the cosmetic options system (see below for more details), and are now read from the `host.yaml` file of the person who patches the ROM\r\n\r\n- **Improved filler item pool**\r\n    - Filler item pool used to be filled to the brim with Rupees, which made it uninteresting at best and frustrating at worst\r\n    - Random rings (following the ring quality option) can now appear as filler items, giving rings that weren\u2019t placed previously. This means you get slightly more ring variety on each seed.\r\n    - Smaller Ore Chunks (x10 and x25) can now appear in the item pool as filler items. It was tough to put packs of 50 Ore Chunks in big amounts, those two new items will help providing a more continuous flow of Ore Chunks throughout the seed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f New Options\r\n\r\n- **Shuffle Essences** (\u201dEssence-sanity\u201d)\r\n    - If enabled, all essences are shuffled anywhere in the multiworld instead of being locked at the end of their respective dungeons\r\n    - This also means post-boss pedestals can host any item, leading to potentially\u2026 *interesting* situations\r\n\r\n- **Deterministic Gasha Nuts** (\u201dGasha-sanity\u201d)\r\n    - Sets the number of Gasha Nuts that will contain pre-generated items, from 0 to 16 (defaults to 0)\r\n    - Each one of those nuts will have to be obtained from trees planted on **unique soil: s**etting a value of 16 will require you to plant a tree on every single soil in the game\r\n    - As those are handled in logic, this means those nuts can contain progression items required by you or your friends to complete the seed\r\n    - Logic expects you to:\r\n        - be able to reach a new soil each time\r\n        - have enough seeds to plant\r\n        - be able to kill enemies in order to make the seed grow\r\n        - be able to harvest the nut (any sword or Fool\u2019s Ore)\r\n    - Once all deterministic Gasha Nuts have been opened, the vanilla random reward algorithm kicks in for any other Gasha Nut obtained. Soils that previously disappeared will stay dead forever, though.\r\n\r\n- **Extended Portal Shuffle**\r\n    - You can now choose among \u201cShuffle Outwards\u201d and \u201cShuffle\u201d to set if portals can lead to other portals from the same dimension\r\n    - This means you can now have Holodrum portals leading to other Holodrum portals (and the same goes for Subrosia)\r\n    - One portal is guaranteed to link both dimensions to avoid blocking a full dimension entirely\r\n    - Picking \u201cShuffle Outwards\u201d does the exact same thing as before, forcing portals to connect to a portal from the opposite dimension\r\n\r\n- **Start With Maps & Compasses**\r\n    - Enabling this makes you start with Maps & Compasses for every dungeon, which is especially useful for newcomers\r\n    - It also removes those items from the pool, adding variety to items that can be found inside dungeons\r\n    - Unlike `start_inventory_from_pool`, items are given silently and instantly at the beginning of the seed\r\n\r\n- **Randomize Lost Woods Main Sequence**:\r\n    - In a similar way to \u201cRandomize Lost Woods Item Sequence\u201d, this enables randomizing the sequence which leads to Tarm Ruins / D6\r\n    - If enabled, you need to use a shield against the Deku Scrub in a rabbit hole right after the jewel gate to learn the secret sequence\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## \u2728 Cosmetic Options\r\n\r\nCosmetic options are a new type of options which are contained inside the `host.yaml` config file of the person who patches the ROM, instead of being in the YAML file you pass to the generator.\r\n\r\nIn a racing context, it means a given seed can lead to ROMs with different cosmetic options for each of the racers.\r\n\r\nBy design, these options are guaranteed not to impact generation (at all) nor gameplay (in a significant manner).\r\n\r\n- **Character Sprite**\r\n    - \u26a0\ufe0f No longer in the options YAML\r\n    - It is now possible to manage your own sprite library in your local Archipelago install folder (inside `data/sprites/oos_ooa`)\r\n    - As instructed in the docs, a repo has been set-up to have a comprehensive list of downloadable sprites: https://github.com/Dinopony/oracles-sprites/\r\n    - You can put `random` as a value to pick a random sprite from your library for each generated ROM\r\n    \r\n- **Character Palette**\r\n    - \u26a0\ufe0f No longer in the options YAML\r\n    - You can put `random` as a value to pick a random color for each generated ROM\r\n\r\n- **Heart Beep Interval**\r\n    - \u26a0\ufe0f No longer in the options YAML\r\n\r\n- **Reveal Hidden Subrosia Digging Spots**\r\n    - \u26a0\ufe0f No longer in the options YAML (as a value to \u201cShuffle Golden Ore Chunks\u201d)\r\n    - This also enables putting this on while *not* randomizing the contents, which is something you might want if you\u2019re new to the game\r\n\r\n- **Remove Music**:\r\n    - if enabled, this removes all music in the game while keeping sound effects intact\r\n    - *This is about the 491th time you\u2019re clearing the game, it was about time you could play with your own music.*\r\n    - if you want to remove the SFX as well, you can just turn off the sound output from your emulator instead\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## \u23eb Improvements\r\n\r\n- Initial Maku Tree text has been shortened **significantly**\r\n- Once they have been taken at least once, portals now tell where they lead when selected on the map menu\r\n- Rod of Seasons are now colored matching their season to make them recognizable when they are freestanding items\r\n- When keysanity is on for a given set of dungeon items (small keys, boss keys, maps & compasses), getting such an item tells for which dungeon that item is in the textbox.\r\n- Compass chimes are not triggered anymore when entering a room containing a Dungeon Map\r\n- Dungeon-specific compass chimes are now only used when keysanity is on\r\n- Versions are now strictly checked between generation and patching to ensure compatibility\r\n- When selecting \u201cEnforce Potion in Horon Shop\u201d, the corresponding shop location is now removed (which was especially annoying for tracker completion)\r\n- D8 is now introduced as \u201cSword & Shield Dungeon\u201d instead of \u201cSword & Shield Maze\u201d when entering it (since every other mention of it was using \u201cDungeon\u201d naming)\r\n- When Keysanity is enabled for Small Keys, keydrops no longer have skipped textboxes (to be able to see which dungeon that key is for)\r\n- Shopkeeper now tell the real item name for remote items and who it belongs to (still truncated if it\u2019s too long though). Hints are still given when entering shops to know the full item name\r\n- When \u201cMaster Keys\u201d option is set to \u201cAll Dungeon Keys\u201d, they now have the sprite of the Boss Key instead of the Small Key to reflect their behavior better\r\n- Improved secondary items subscreen layout (fixing Bomb Flower display at the same time)\r\n- The Subrosia Seaside digging spot containing the item is now fixed, being decided at generation time. This was made to ensure better fairness and randomness\r\n- Lost Woods sequences can now require transitions to the right, which wasn\u2019t the case before for technical reasons\r\n- Lost Woods sequences hints now use arrows to describe directions, which is cleaner and more visually understandable\r\n- Moblin King doesn\u2019t talk to you anymore when he notices you to the right of his fort near Sunken City\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## \ud83e\udde0 Logic\r\n\r\n- Fixed D1 Goriya chest potentially being logically accessible without Ember Seeds, whereas it\u2019s impossible in-game (thanks **Ishigh**)\r\n- Fixed Fixed D2 backwards logic not expecting the player to kill enemies when going from the arrow room to the main entrance, whereas it\u2019s needed (thanks **Ishigh**)\r\n- Added bracelet to the list of tools enabling Ore Chunks farming in medium+ logic\r\n- Jumping over a 6-wide liquid (with cape + pegasus seeds) is now in medium logic instead of casual\r\n- Fixed logic expecting the player to go from D6 entrance to Old Man near D6 when spring was not the default season (preventing the player from breaking the \u201cflower pillar\u201d)\r\n- Fixed a rare logic issue where Sunken City shop would become out of logic because there was not enough rupees in the seed\r\n\r\n---\r\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Bugfixes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Fixed a bug preventing from excluding D8 locations using the appropriate location group\r\n- Fixed a bug preventing from putting dungeon items in \u201cstart_inventory\u201d or \u201cstart_inventory_from_pool\u201d\r\n- Fixed buying Zora Ring, Fist Ring, Whimsical Ring or Protection Ring from a shop not giving the right ring\r\n- Fixed seed trees generation not being deterministic (thanks **Ishigh**)\r\n- Shuffled dungeons now appear as \u201cUnknown Dungeon\u201d on the map menu when not visited yet, instead of having showing the region where the shuffled dungeon comes from\r\n- Fixed switching between map modes by pressing START inside the Maku Tree room causing graphical glitches on the map menu\r\n- Fixed the ability to save-scum using warp to start to get a refill before warping back to your previous position using a save & quit\r\n- Fixed generation sometimes failing with default options because of Subrosian Market logic checking Ore Chunks whereas there were almost none in the world\r\n- Fixed Maku Tree tile not being marked as \u201cvisited\u201d on the map when first visit happened after getting a few Essences\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udea7 Known Issues\r\n\r\n- Treasure Map is gone: it was pretty much useless in the current state of the Archipelago implementation and needs some love before it comes back.",

      "description": "Finally, a new update for Seasons!\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f New Options\r\n\r\n- **Placed Essences (0-8)**\r\n    - This defines how many Essences are placed by generation\r\n    - This value must be greater or equal than \u201cRequired Essences\u201d. If it is lower (can happen when either one is set to `random`), a new value is picked randomly in the valid range.\r\n    - Removed essences are replaced by filler items while keeping their distribution behavior (meaning they will be placed on dungeon end pedestals if essence-sanity is disabled)\r\n    - If some dungeon end pedestals were specifically excluded, those essences are excluded in priority if \u201cShuffle Essences\u201d is disabled\r\n    \r\n- **Exclude Dungeons Without Essences**\r\n    - If enabled, you are only expected to clear dungeons where an essence can be found on the post-boss pedestal\r\n    - This is useful when \u201cPlaced Essences\u201d is lower than 8, where you would still need to enter dungeons where there is no essence just in case a progression item would be there\r\n    - If \u201cShuffle Essences\u201d is enabled, this option has no effect since most dungeons would have no essence anyway\r\n    - All dungeons remain completable according to chosen accessibility rule\r\n    - This is especially interesting when used in pair with `start_hints` in order to know from the start which dungeons must be done and which ones must be ignored\r\n\r\n- **Shuffle Business Scrubs**\r\n    - If enabled, all four business scrubs which are accessible in rando will sell a one-time item that is randomized and handled in logic:\r\n        - in Spool Swamp, near floodgate keyhole\r\n        - in regular Samasa Desert quicksands\r\n        - near D2 alt. entrance spiral room\r\n        - before D4 mini-boss\r\n    - If disabled or once their item has been bought, they sell a refill (similar to Impa) for 30 Rupees\r\n    - This makes them relevant in some specific cases but still optional if you don\u2019t want them in your pool of locations\r\n    - \u26a0\ufe0f Be careful: the scrubs in D2 and D4 can contain dungeon items like small keys or boss keys for that dungeon, just like any other location in there!\r\n\r\n- **The \u201cShop Prices Factor\u201d option is replaced by a new \u201cShop Prices\u201d option**\r\n    - This option can have the following values:\r\n        - **Vanilla** \u2192 same prices as in vanilla game (roughly, Subrosian Market prices are the ones for successive vanilla rings, since they only contain Ore Chunks)\r\n        - **Free** \u2192 all shop checks can be obtained for free\r\n        - **Randomized (Cheap)** \u2192 prices are randomized with an average cost of 50\r\n        - **Randomized (Reasonable)** \u2192 prices are randomized with an average cost of 100\r\n        - **Randomized (Expensive) \u2192** prices are randomized with an average cost of 200\r\n        - **Randomized (Outrageous) \u2192** prices are randomized with an average cost of 300\r\n    - This option applies to:\r\n        - All overworld shops\r\n        - The Subrosian Market\r\n        - Business scrubs (if randomized)\r\n\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Bugfixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed generation not working on recent versions of Archipelago caused by a breaking change in Archipelago core\r\n- Fixed portals from overworld to overworld sometimes not setting season properly\r\n- Fixed Rosa date not stopping when taking a portal from Subrosia to Subrosia\r\n- Fixed a generation issue when using  `non_local_items: Everything` and Master Keys at the same time\r\n- Fixed receiving items near a screen border causing a \u201ctext warp\u201d (you can no longer receive items when near the edge of a room)\r\n- Fixed a rare generation issue where it would sometimes fail with a very specific random portal layout\r\n- Fixed some items with long names causing crashes in some shop slots\r\n- Fixed quick season switching not working with spring\r\n\r\n\r\n## \ud83e\udde0 Logic\r\n\r\n- Fixed a logic issue where \u201cD7 right of entrance chest\u201d did not expect the player to kill enemies\r\n- Fixed an issue where Lost Woods default season was checked against both sequences in a wrong manner\r\n- Fixed a logic issue regarding Spool Swamp logic in spring (spotted by Mashy, fixed by Ishigh)\r\n- Added Mystery Seeds as a valid option to summon and beat first Poe in D7 (medium logic and above)\r\n- Fixed a logic issue regarding access to Ingo for trading Goron Vase (spotted by Sagaz)\r\n- Fixed a logic issue regarding season change to access Golden Darknut (spotted thanks to OmegaZeron\u2019s tracker)\r\n- Fixed an issue regarding the size of a liquid pool leading to vanilla Magnetic Glove chest in D5 (hard logic only)\r\n- Fixed an issue where Syrup shop would be unreachable in casual logic because of rupee costs (spotted by LinksMan)\r\n- Fixed an logic issue where player was expected to summon Maple by killing enemies using Gale Seeds (spotted by OmegaZeron)\r\n- Added Feather as a requirement to jump over spiked floor in D6 north of spinner path\r\n- Fixed a logic issue where pits in \u201cD4 Stalfos stairs room\u201d were not requiring Pegasus Seeds in casual logic, even though they are 2 tiles wide\r\n- Hard logic now expects infinite rupee manips when owning the Shovel\r\n\r\n\r\n## \u23eb Miscellaneous Improvements\r\n\r\n- The whole way rupees and shops are handled has been improved\r\n    - There is now a random \u201cshop order\u201d that is detemined randomly when generating the seed\r\n    - Logic expects you to buy useful items from shops using this shop order\r\n    - First shops (logic-wise) are made cheaper when prices are randomized, while last shops in the shop order are made more expensive\r\n- Default text speed is now 5 when creating a save file\r\n- Maple can no longer randomly drop a Piece of Heart or a Gasha Seed, which could provide an unfair advantage in racing context\r\n- Topology is now enabled for that world, which means you can output spoiler logs with detailed paths to items",

      "description": "## \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f New Options\r\n\r\n- **Secret Locations**\r\n    - If enabled, all ten linked game secrets are available as location:\r\n        - In Horon Village, in the hidden stairs behind the clock shop\r\n        - In the graveyard, in the hidden stairs behind a tombstone\r\n        - In Subrosia, in the cave with grass in it\r\n        - In Sunken City, in the house in front of the entrance\r\n        - In Subrosia, in the forge\r\n        - In Subrosia, in the pirate house after they left\r\n        - In the Temple of Seasons, beyond the waterfall\r\n        - In Natzu, when talking to the deku while having every seed type\r\n        - In the Goron Mountain, after giving a hot soup to Biggoron\r\n        - In Horon Village, after receiving the mayor's gift\r\n\r\n- **Show Dungeons With Essence**\r\n    - This option is only relevant with excluded essences and essences not shuffled\r\n    - This option can have the following values:\r\n        - **Disabled** \u2192 Nothing special\r\n        - **With Compass** \u2192 Sparkles will appear on the entrance of the dungeon on the map if the Compass was obtained and the dungeon has an Essence \r\n        - **Always** \u2192 Sparkles will appear on the entrance of the dungeon on the map if the dungeon has an Essence\r\n    - The dungeon located in Subrosia will shine on that map, not on the Temple Remains\r\n\r\n- **Rosa Quick Unlock**\r\n    - If enabled, Rosa will be unable to be dated and will instead unlock all the doors she could open in Subrosia instantly\r\n\r\n- **The \"Remove Useless Rings\" option is now \"Required Rings\" and \"Excluded Rings\"**\r\n    - **Excluded Rings** removes all selected rings from the pool of rings that can be included for the world\r\n        - **Excluded Rings** is by default all the rings that are excluded by Remove Useless Rings\r\n    - **Required Rings** forces the chosen rings to be in the pool of items for the world\r\n        - The Required Rings are forced to not be in barren dungeons (unless the accessibility is set to minimal)\r\n        - \u26a0\ufe0f Having too many required rings while having few locations may cause failures\r\n    - Both options can be used to have rings in the start inventory:\r\n        - A ring can be excluded and be added to the start inventory\r\n        - A ring can be required and be added to the start inventory from pool\r\n        - The only difference between the two approaches is that the first approach will leave a random ring in the pool while the other leaves a random filler in the pool\r\n\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Bugfixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed generation not working if D2 or D4 was barren while deku scrubs were randomized\r\n- Fixed the deku scrub at the floodgate making the gasha spot disappear if the check was bought before the nut was gathered\r\n- Fixed portal shuffle failing to recognize having d8 unreachable while less than 8 essences were placed but as many were required made the game unbeatable\r\n- Fixed portal shuffle considering upper temple remain \u2194 subrosia volcano as the only connection to subrosia was a valid layout\r\n- Prevent dungeon items from being added in the item pool if they are going to be assigned to a dungeon, as removing them from the pool isn't compliant with Archipelago guidelines\r\n\r\n\r\n## \ud83e\udde0 Logic\r\n\r\n- Fixed dungeon-locked items (such as keys) being placed without any logic (often resulting with a failure)\r\n- Fixed old men logic with negative value breaking Archipelago's generation algorithm by locking away some shop items by getting access to them\r\n- It is now in logic to jump in the d0 chimney without d0 access\r\n- Logic now expects to exit D2 from the alt entrance\r\n- Added a path in logic to go from Facade to the entrance in D2\r\n- Fixed logic related to exiting D5 (entering through d2 alt entrance)\r\n- Added a path in logic going through Vire's portal to get to spinner north, making **Ancient Ruins (2F): Chest North of Main Spinner** available with a single key\r\n- Logic is now affected by rings in medium logic\r\n- In medium logic, if the lost wood paths aren't randomized, it is not required by logic to talk to \"learn\" the sequence\r\n- It is now in medium logic to punch levers from minecarts\r\n- It is now in logic to use ember and mystery seeds to trigger levers from minecarts\r\n- Added a path in logic to allow to get the old man near Blaino to be accessed by using Moosh to jump above holes\r\n- Updated the Temple remains logic to be accessible in more ways\r\n- Reworked the logic to beat ganon:\r\n    - Ganon now requires a noble sword to be beaten in casual logic\r\n    - Ganon can be beaten with any seed in medium logic\r\n    - Ganon can be beaten with a satchel instead of a slingshot in hard logic\r\n- Spring is no longer required in logic to jump from sunken city to eastern suburbs\r\n- Free shops no longer require rupee farming to be available\r\n- Fixed 30 rupee packs not being counted in logic\r\n- Fixed keylocked key logic that would sometimes break in keysanity\r\n\r\n\r\n## \u23eb Miscellaneous Improvements\r\n\r\n- Barren dungeons now are forced to hold their dungeon related items even with keysanity due to the number of checks in the overworld being too low\r\n- Small rupee packs (such as Rupees (1)) relative to the others cannot be progression anymore\r\n- Reworked Ore Chunk to be generated in a similar way to Rupees in the item pool\r\n- Renamed Natzu: Chest after Moblin Keep to Natzu Region: Chest after Moblin Keep for naming consistency\r\n- Planted and gathered Gasha seeds are now auto-tracked on the tracker (assuming it was updated)\r\n- Warp to start is now mandatory\r\n- Rings that have no effect on logic are now fillers by defaults and can be found in barren dungeons\r\n- The minimum number of Gasha Seeds is now fixed to the number of Gasha locations instead of 14",
