And then disable them once more to adventure unbothered!\r\n- Archipelago Stone: New starting item for Regionsanity that you can use to teleport to your starting location whenever you want\r\n- Earn Your Info: New Item Info Mode choice that hides the usefulness of checks on the map until you complete 50% of your game\r\n- Locations? Grouped: Added location groups for Crystals, Bosses, Shops, and Region Completions, which can be used to 1) exclude them from having good items or 2) as priority locations, like:\r\n- Crystals?

Have a Suggestion?\r\n- Check if it's in here: <https://github.com/Emerassi/CrystalProjectAPWorld/issues>\r\n- If not, please add it! :> Thanks!\r\n\r\n### Big thanks to everyone who had suggestions, requests, or reported bugs! We've made a lot of improvements thanks to you. \ud83d\udc9d\r\n### This update's a whopper!\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n- Home Point Hustle: Add every save point as a location!\r\n  - Hustle Only: Can ONLY teleport to a save point if you've found its matching teleport item (touching does not unlock warp!)\r\n  - Mixed: Can teleport to a save point either if you've touched it or if you've found its matching teleport item.\r\n- Passive Point Party: Change the number of Passive Points you start with and/or set a maximum number to unlock with Passive Point Boost items!\r\n- Hop To It: Increase the level of platforming skill you're expected to use to get checks! (Only a handful of these are in so far; please feel free to suggest more places where you can commit platforming crimes to be added to these rules!)\r\n  - Fancy Footwork: Above-average jumping skill expected.\r\n  - One Hop Beyond: More jumping tricks expected, like ibek jumping up from underneath an overhang.\r\n  - Pray: Who needs the Golden Quintar in The Sequoia? Not you!\r\n- Improved Item Info: The Locations list now displays an icon for each location so you can tell what type of item is hiding there (as long as you haven't picked Item Info: Obscured, or if you've earned it in Item Info: Earned!)\r\n- Save Slot Labels: Your Archipelago slot name and port number are now displayed in your in-game save slots! Now you don't have to wonder which save goes with which multiworld.\r\n- Free Me: Added a button to release all your items in the Goal menu in-game.\r\n- Personal Growth: Added the Growth Change menu to the in-game Archipelago menu; no need for a trip to Capital Sequoia to adjust your stats!\r\n\r\n### Upgrades\r\n- Starting Level: Players can now set their starting level in the YAML, completely separate from Progressive Level Size!\r\n- New Keep Construction: For the Astley & True Astley goal, the New World Stone is now in the items pool instead of being sent when you get enough jobs. Now, there is a mysterious wall blocking your path to the final fight that will only disappear when you have collected enough Jobs!\r\n- Regionsanity:\r\n  - The World Your Oyster: Starter regions can now be ANY region with enough available checks to start!\r\n  - Fishy Friend: If your starter region is The Open Sea, The Deep Sea, or The Depths (haha enjoy that), you start with a Salmon Violin.\r\n  - Starter Region Levels: Players can now pick what level range they want their random starter region to be in! (Note: if the game picks a higher level region than you set for your Starting Level, you will be leveled up appropriately; otherwise, you'll start at whatever Starting Level you set.)\r\n  - A Fresh Start: Changed starting points in several regions to be more interesting/have more locations immediately available: The Sequoia, The Chalice of Tar, Jidamba Eaclaneya, Beaurior Rock, and The Deep Sea\r\n  - Animated Entry: When entering a region that you have the Region Pass for, a pass icon will appear along with the name of the region. It's very cute!\r\n  - Hit the Ground Running: Teleports you instantly to your starter region instead of the slow fall to Spawning Meadows.\r\n- More Mod Compatible: Mods newer than editor version 30 are now compatible with our version of the game! I.e., any mod that's compatible with the current version of Crystal Project in the main branch is now compatible with our Archipelago mod of the game! :tada:\r\n- Region Rework Continues: Even more regions revamped! Notably, Cobblestone Crag, Greenshire Reprise, Sara Sara Beach **(no longer split into East and West!)**, Salmon Bay, Shoudu Province (hissssss), Undercity, Beaurior Volcano, Beaurior Rock, Quintar Reserve, Slip Glide Ride, The Chalice of Tar, Flyer's Crag, and Jidamba Eaclaneya\r\n- Locations? Even More Grouped: Added location groups for each region, each subregion (like Sky Arena), Purple Chests, Ore Nodes, End-Game Bosses, Secret Herbs, Black Squirrels, Dog Bones, Clamshells, and Quintar Sheddings, Mount Instruments, Bribe Quests, Challenge Quests, Fetch Quests, Collectible Turn-Ins, Fishers, Gifts, Luxury Pass Required, Job Checkers, and Salmon Race Prizes\r\n- More Legible Maps: When hovering a location on the world map, the name will now be displayed on two lines instead of one, so my very long location names can still be read easily! ^_^;;\r\n- Speedier Navigation: Using the left or right bumper to scroll the Regions list will now jump twice as far up or down the list.\r\n- Handy Generation Notes: Generation output will now have a message with your starter region and level.\r\n- Beepier Boops: Autojump toggle will now make a different sound effect when you turn it on vs when you turn it off.\r\n- Thanks For That: Messages about items you've received will now tell you who sent it to you. So you can thank them for that Crag Demon Trap. :D\r\n- **Explorer YAML updated with new settings!**\r\n\r\n### Downgrades\r\n- Async Lifesaver: No more drowning in messages (probably)! When you connect, messages will only display for items you received while offline if they are progression. And if multiple Progressive Levels have been received, only one summary message will display!\r\n- One At a Time: Progressive Level Size's minimum has been reduced to 1.\r\n- Little a Clam As a Treat: Clamshells goal minimum has been reduced to 1.\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n - Fixed crash on evaluating accessible but out of logic regions.\r\n - Fixed Enable Sparks button not working if Regionsanity was off.\r\n - Fixed laggy world map.\r\n - Fixed level gating calculations!! Again!!!!\r\n - No longer expects player to be able to earn money in subregions without combat in regions where other subregions have combat.\r\n - No longer breaks if non-.json files are in the player's mod folder (including zipped-up packages of mods).\r\n - Fixed another east/weast location name mistake in Jidamba Tangle (thanks Corence!)\r\n - Game no longer thinks Golden Quintar is a salmon (thanks Sterlia!)\r\n - Removed incorrect connection from Salmon River -> Salmon Bay (thanks Zeno!)\r\n - Removed incorrect connection between Proving Meadows and The Pale Grotto (thanks Azuri and Woli!)\r\n - Ibek Bell and Sky Arena locations that require Arachlea are now removed if Kill Bosses is off (thanks PyroGnome!)\r\n - Fixed broken passive trees when using class ability rando.\r\n - Fixed LP rollover being inconsistent sometimes with scholar and summoner. It also plays well now with summoner and scholar abilities if they are randomized into the pool.\r\n - Level ups no longer happening before class selection for sure this time!!!\r\n - Fixed incorrect icon for Awl Drum.\r\n - Fixed Tangle sparks aggroing on you like they're bosses when they only have a chance to be Rexosaur. Those posers.\r\n - Regionsanity:\r\n    - Region Completion message pop-ups should now always come after the message for the item you just found to complete the region.\r\n    - Fixed some connections not getting re-checked for whether they're in logic in non-Extreme.\r\n    - Fixed code that checked if a region was accessible but out of logic (yellow in the Regions list) to check the actual region and not a subregion.\r\n    - Lost Son check is now out of logic without both the Sara Sara Bazaar Pass and Poko Poko Desert Pass.\r\n    - If a player has a Region Pass in their starting inventory that is not in their included regions, generation will fail with a useful error message to prevent picking an invalid starter region.\r\n    - If you never set your home point, the game will respawn you at your Regionsanity starting location instead of Spawning Meadows (unless, of course, your starting location happens to be in Spawning Meadows).\r\n\r\n### KNOWN ISSUES\r\n- Only works on the Steam version\r\n- YOU THOUGHT THIS LINE WOULD BE ABOUT MODS BUT FINALLY IT ISN'T! ALL MODS ALLOWED WOOOO\r\n- The timer on the first Regionsanity Extreme teleport out of a prohibited region may be way too short\r\n- Fixed in v.0.12.1 hotfix:\r\n  - Beastmaster Crystal access rule mistakenly requires owl instead of ibek.\r\n  - Installer crashes if player doesn't already have expected files.\r\n  - Modded shops accidentally added twice to locations.\r\n  - Modded locations that change entity types don't remove remove the vanilla location (hi, FFP Jidamba Crystal! \ud83d\udc4b).\r\n  - Modded locations share IDs with Region Completion locations (boy FFP is big :) ).\r\n- Fixed in v0.12.2 hotfix:\r\n  - Multiple mods changing the same location crashes the game.\r\n  - Mods adding a second type of check to the same NPC crashes the game (known to happen with FFP).\r\n- Fixed in v0.13.0 (not compatible with v0.12.x worlds):\r\n  - Enabling **Use Mods** creates corrupted save files (you'll know by the save slot overflowing with a bunch of random letters & symbols).\r\n  - Interacting with a modded home point crashes the game.\r\n  - **Regionsanity**: trying to teleport to your spawn point with Salmon Bay as your starter region teleports you to Spawning Meadows on a fish.\r\n\r\nRegions touched in the latest rework: **Sara Sara Beach (no longer split into East and West)**, Sara Sara Bazaar, Poko Poko Desert, Ancient Reservoir, The Deep Sea, Castle Ramparts, The New World, The Sequoia, Ancient Labyrinth, **Quintar Reserve**, **Flyer's Crag**, **The Chalice of Tar**, Rolling Quintar Fields, Quintar Sanctum, Dione Shrine, Okimoto N.S., **Shoudu Province**, The Open Sea, Eastern Chasm, Tall, Tall Heights, Capital Jail, Jojo Sewers, **Jidamba Eaclaneya**, **Beaurior Volcano**, **Beaurior Rock**, **Cobblestone Crag**, Quintar Nest, Okimoto N.S., **Undercity**, Capital Pipeline, **Salmon Bay**, Salmon River, Northern Cave, **Slip Glide Ride**, **Greenshire Reprise**, Delende, Salmon Pass, Capital Sequoia",

This is the percentage chance that a trap replaces a filler item, a value of 0 means there will be no traps in your seed.\r\n  - Traps will mess with the player in such ways as showing dialog blocks, teleporting the player, and spawning boss sparks.\r\n- AutoJump Toggle Keybind: Tired of jumping at weird times when you didn't want to but you still like AutoJump?  Well that will still happen sometimes because you'll forget if it's currently on or off but at least you can now keybind AutoJump and toggle it easily.\r\n- New LevelGating Option: Choose LevelGating = Set to make it combine the effects of Cap and Catchup meaning you can never earn exp and only gain levels from items.  Who needs grinding?\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n\r\n- Messages will now show even if auto saving or music track information is on screen.  The new zone name will still hide messages for a while so be patient.

So if you turned Shopsanity and Kill Bosses Mode both on or both off it was fine, and otherwise it was not.  This v0.4.1 update is entirely to fix this bug.  The only thing changed is a new .apworld.  The v0.4 yaml and Installer are unchanged.\r\n\r\n### KNOWN ISSUES\r\n- Only works on the Steam version\r\n- Checks obtained in regions considered inaccessible confuses in-game tracking\r\n- Some bosses are not included in Kill Boss mode (yet)",
