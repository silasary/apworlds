      "description": "# Dark Cloud 1 v0.1.0\r\nFirst release! Utan%\r\n## Game\r\n- The georama for the first 2 dungeons are currently the only things shuffled\r\n- Many scenes/conversations are removed if they don't yield an item\r\n- Georama pieces will automatically be placed in their respective buildings.  If you get an item and don't see it, it is likely for a building you don't own yet; trust that it is there (this will change in 0.2)\r\n  - Also, it *should* be safe to move pieces around, but do so carefully as once you complete a building, you can't take pieces back out and could lock yourself out of progress to build the wrong buildings.\r\n- Save stating is currently untested, so use at your own peril! (It should be fine in most situations, just save state after connecting the client)\r\n- This is the first release, so there will likely be bugs\r\n\r\n## Known issues\r\n- `!collect` handling is not yet implemented\r\n- Previously collected atla won't be sent to the server on connection, so make sure to only collect atla while the client is connected for now\r\n- The client will likely crash if you close the emulator\r\n\r\n\r\n[Setup](https://github.com/Lizardman175/DC1AP/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#readme)",

      "description": "# Dark Cloud 1 Rando v0.2.0 Saia%\r\nHappy Thanksgiving! (Canadian; Early)\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n1. Added Queens/Shipwreck.  Goal option now goes to 3!\r\n    - Recruiting Goro will unlock Queens.  Getting Ruby before Goro causes all sorts of problems so the game has to be more linear than I'd like for now.\r\n    - No need to have Yaya dance on your head.  The flags will be set for those scenes after the building completion scene with her now.\r\n        - This also means Rando's shop goes away as soon as you chat with Yaya after finishing the Divining House, so buy things you need there first!\r\n2. Changed georama pieces to be progressive\r\n    - General progression rules: Building -> All pieces that yield miracle chests -> NPCs -> Other pieces -> Stray Cat (it just felt right having the cat be last for Toan's house)\r\n3. Added ABS multiplier YAML option for faster (or slower?) weapon exp growth\r\n4. Added starter weapons YAML option to jump start the game a bit with some free early game weapons (Shamshir, Steel slingshot, etc.)\r\n5. Background logic and item classification updates to make chest rando smoother to develop some day\r\n6. Improved message received dialog so other dialogs/entering a dungeon floor don't stomp on it (items are still received regardless of the messages displayed)\r\n7. Fixed race condition preventing receipt of items from other games in the multi-world\r\n8. Fixed a client crash when trying to connect with a bad slot name\r\n9. Improved boss kill handling\r\n10. Future town georama menus are no longer visible until you have access to the town (recruit Xiao/Goro). This was giving the player early access to the towns that could lead to issues if you get the characters out of sequence.\r\n11. Misc code improvements\r\n12. Secret bonus update :)\r\n\r\n### Will not work with existing MWs",

Big releases can still cause some brief lag but its not as bad.\r\n - Improved protection against loading the wrong file by adding the room seed to the save file\r\n - Small changes to georama names\r\n - Changes to the order geo pieces are received to account for chest logic\r\n - Fixed 2 buildings in Queens not facing the way I intended with autobuild\r\n - Fixed only needing the Divining House done to access Saia.  Now requires watching the Cathedral's completion scene to fight Saia like vanilla.\r\n - Changed how ABS multiplier works, should be more reliable\r\n - Universal Tracker now works with DC1\r\n - Small effeciency improvements to rule logic to speed up world gen\r\n - Save state loading should be a little better, but isn't perfect yet.  Just reset the game before loading the save state. Still prefer using normal saves for safety.\r\n - Optional .pnach file to allow display of all towns' georama inventories\r\n\r\n### Known issues:\r\n - Save before getting Ruby, there is a known bug causing the client to fail giving the floor update and her extra weapon\r\n - The client doesn't have highlight like other clients for now\r\n - The client doesn't log hints\r\n - Enter key in the text box doesn't send, have to hit the 'send' button directly\r\n",
