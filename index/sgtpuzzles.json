This will allow puzzles using the `N` key to work properly, such as particularly large Group or Solo puzzles.\r\n- The \"solve\" hotkey is also disabled in the same circumstances. Sorry! (You can still force-solve puzzles by typing `solvePuzzle()` into the browser console.)\r\n- Updated the base game, which brings in some nice improvements like allowing `Backspace` to clear cells in Filling.\r\n\r\nThere are no AP world changes in this update.

Simply connect with any existing savefile to sync its solved puzzles.\r\n- The new `fixed_puzzles` option for the apworld lets you specify a list of puzzles to always place in a world, ignoring `genre_weights`. You can specify these puzzles as just a genre (in which case a preset will be chosen randomly as usual), or you can supply an options string or even a specific puzzle ID or seed.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- Puzzles no longer regenerate from a seed if there's already save data for that puzzle. This means large puzzles will load much faster after you click \"Save Puzzle Progress\" for the first time. (In case there are any problems with loading the puzzle, you can delete these saves with the debug command `deletePuzzleData(index)`.)\r\n- Added missing `6dh` and `6de` presets for Dominosa.\r\n- Manifest added to apworld in preparation for Archipelago 0.7.\r\n\r\nWeb client: https://ishanpm.github.io/ap-sgtpuzzles-web/\r\n\r\nAP World source code: https://github.com/ishanpm/Archipelago-sgtpuzzles/tree/e84c2da7ee7cad5d62d08228c077fe331b1e85fe/worlds/sgtpuzzles",
