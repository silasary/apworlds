See in-game tracker for details.\r\n\t- 34 new default locations, and 72 new logsanity locations. See in-game tracker for details.\r\n\t- `goal` option has 4 new values: the old Song of Six has been renamed to Song of the Nomai, and we now have Echoes of the Eye (just complete the DLC), Song of the Stranger (reach Eye with Prisoner), a new Song of Six (reach Eye with either Solanum or Prisoner) and Song of Seven (reach Eye with both).\r\n\t- `spawn` option has a new value of `stranger`\r\n\t- Added owlk screams to the Audio Trap when DLC is enabled\r\n\t- Random Ghost Matter setting now affects GM inside The Stranger\r\n- The base game rando now has items and locations for the Deep Space Radio frequency and its two signals, since those exist when the DLC is not installed, and I decided they are not relevant for DLC logic.\r\n- Added item name groups \"Base Progression\", \"DLC Progression\", \"Quantum Rules\", \"Patches\" and location name groups \"The Stranger\", \"Dreamworld\", \"Interloper\", \"Sun Station\", \"WHS\"\r\n- Fixed in-game tracker failing to show non-OW item names on hinted locations, and non-OW location names on hinted items.\r\n- Fixed logic for WHS projection stone logsanity locations that were made retroactively incorrect by warp platform rando.\r\n- Fixed the apworld's region connection code to properly set \"indirect connections\". Although no user-facing bugs were reported due to this, it was technically incorrect and could theoretically have led to generating unwinnable multiworlds, especially in the DLC's more complex logic.\r\n- Fixed logic for Village 1-2 logsanity locations incorrectly expecting you to reach Timber Hearth, and the Village to Timber Hearth connection incorrectly expecting Launch Codes instead of just Spacesuit.\r\n\r\nIf you played [the last release candidate](https://github.com/Ixrec/OuterWildsArchipelagoRandomizer/releases/tag/v0.3.0-rc3), the only change not mentioned above is that when you don't have Projection Range Patch, being teleported back to the artifact now resets your velocity so you can't accidentally kill yourself that way.",

      "description": "For installation instructions [see the README](https://github.com/Ixrec/OuterWildsArchipelagoRandomizer#installation).\r\n\r\nThe most important part of this update is:\r\n\r\n- Stop setting an explicit Archipelago client protocol version to the MultiClient.Net library, so the library will default to setting its own more up-to-date protocol version instead. This matters because when Archipelago 0.6.0 comes out, archipelago.gg is expected to start **_rejecting all connections from older versions of this mod_** that were incorrectly specifying an older protocol version.\r\n\r\nThat's why I wanted to get this update out now, while there's still plenty of time for it to fully replace 0.3.11 before AP 0.6.0 comes out. To go along with that, I've also implemented and reviewed the following low-risk bug fixes and contributions:\r\n\r\n- Fixed EotU Coordinates in Suit Log. Now all of the Suit Log entries that show the Coordinates should work even if you haven't opened the Ship Log first.\r\n- Slightly tweaked Brittle Hollow spawn position. The ship now faces the wall, so you won't get stuck on a tree if you press forward during liftoff. (thanks @RS-Mind)\r\n- Fixed Nomai Text Colorization for AP items with both `progression` and `useful` flags. (thanks @ScipioWright)\r\n- Fixed several errors in the Sixth Location logsanity descriptions (thanks Useless for pointing these out)\r\n- Solved \"the recursive EP3 problem\". If you rolled a Dark Bramble layout where the Escape Pod 3 room's inner portal led into Escape Pod 3 again, then it was impossible to leave (and follow your Scout marker to The Vessel) because \"backing out\" of the room was also recursive. To solve this, the \"backing out\" warps that don't lead to outer space will now warp you to the first DB room instead (whatever that is for your random layout), so now it should always be possible to get back to space and/or follow the Scout marker after reaching the grave seed.\r\n- Added Quothe's and Skurry's OW AP rando videos to the README",

This time it was a backwards incompatible change to the upcoming \"hint status\" feature, so updating to MultiClient.Net v6.6.0 should prevent errors about `hint_status` when the mod generates AP hints.\r\n- Yaml-less Univeral Tracker support. You no longer need to hang on to your .yaml file to use Universal Tracker with outer_wilds.apworld.\r\n- Tweak the code that handles receiving items from the Archipelago server so most of it runs in Unity's Update() methods instead of the Archipelago websocket thread. There's a theory that the websocket thread is more unstable than the threads Unity expects to exist (which is supported by experience from a few other rando projects), so maybe this will help with the end-of-loop native crashes.",

This bug allowed you to \"take off\" and then put on the suit without receiving the \"Spacesuit\" AP item.\r\n\t- Fixed the Spacesuit appearing in your ship (before receiving the \"Spacesuit\" AP item) when you warp into a New Horizons custom system\r\n\t- The warp to Sun Station is supposed to logically require Spacesuit, but due to a lambda capture bug (found by mysteryem's new fuzzer hook) it didn't in practice. This has now been fixed, so it's no longer theoretically possible for Spacesuit to get placed inside the Sun Station.\r\n\t- Somehow, the in-game tracker had an equivalent bug despite being completely different code, so it was not showing the \"(Item: Spacesuit)\" requirement on this connection. That's also fixed now.\r\n- Fixed warping from a NewHorizons system back to the vanilla Outer Wilds system. Previously, this would often hang forever on the loading screen. (thanks msyverw / RS_Mind for pinning this down and prototyping a fix)\r\n- Changed the implementation details of trap_type_weights and upgrade_counts so that:\r\n\t- The keys can now be omitted, with the same meaning as an explicit 0. For example, `trap_type_weights: { \"Supernova Trap\": 1 }` is valid now; no more listing 0s for all the other traps.\r\n\t- These options can now also be edited by AP's built-in \"Options Creator\" (and probably unofficial webhosts).\r\n- Tweaked the tracker descriptions for Gabbro's Island 3 and 4 so they now explicitly say exactly how many loops are required to unlock these log facts\r\n- Finally removed all of the [DEBUG] mod settings\r\n- Fixed the `Location SLF__TH_VILLAGE_X3 is missing an AP id, so not sending anything to the AP server` warning",

The main appeal of this mod is the unique \"Threader\" item, which is a grapple beam/hook that works on any surface in the game.\r\n\t- `enable_eh_mod` option. When this is `true`, Threader use will be in-logic for:\r\n\t\t- Entering the BH Forge without a \"warp path\" to the Hanging City Ceiling\r\n\t\t- Climbing up into the bottom floor of GD tower rather than solving the Imaging Rule puzzles above\r\n\t\t- (if `enable_eote_dlc` is also `true`) Navigating The Stranger without rafts / Stranger Light Modulator\r\n\t\t- (if `enable_fc_mod` is also `true`) Reaching the Eye Signal Lab without the crystal puzzle\r\n\t- After receiving the \"Threader\" AP item, actual Threaders will be placed near all of your possible spawn points, including DLC and story mod systems.\r\n\t- 11 new AP locations (3 default, 8 logsanity) on the Echo Hike planet itself\r\n- The \"[Archipelago Hints]\" option in NPC dialogue trees has been moved near the bottom, to reduce the risk of accidentally spending your hint by mashing through the dialogue (thanks aXu-AP)\r\n- The custom loading spinner (with the 6 colored moons instead of 1 orange moon) has been fixed\r\n- Previously, the \"AP Console: Drop All AP Server Messages\" setting would write AP server messages to the mod logs instead of the in-game console. Now, it won't write the messages anywhere at all. Hopefully this improves attempts to use this setting to mitigate instability in large multiworlds.",

This goal requires meeting a certain number of \"friends\" before going to the Eye. For example, if you enable the DLC and all 7 story mods, `song_of_the_universe: true` and `required_friends: 9` will require you to reach the ends of the DLC and all 7 story mods before goaling.\r\n- Added option groups. Since this is a custom game, mostly this means reordering and adding headers to the template/example .yamls, but you may also see these on alternate webhosts. \r\n- Universal Tracker nits:\r\n\t- In `shuffle_spacesuit: true` slots, Universal Tracker's `/next_progression` command should now be aware of the Spacesuit item\r\n\t- The Universal Tracker code can now handle missing options in slot_data. This probably has no impact today, but the next time we add a new logic-relevant option, it should allow UT with the latest OW apworld to just work on slots generated before the option was added.\r\n\t- Some dead code required by older Universal Tracker versions has been cleaned up (specifically the `interpret_slot_data` stub)\r\n",
