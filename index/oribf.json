When these options are enabled, there will be separate keystones/mapstones for each major area of the map. Logically, this means most keystone doors require less keystones but will require specific types. And for mapstones, each area's mapstone will have its own item, rather than 9 generic mapstones.\r\n- Death Link is now supported. There are three options: disabled, partial, and full. Disabled means no death link. Full means every death sends a death link. And Partial means instant deaths (like getting caught by Kuro) will be excluded from sending death links.\r\n\r\nThis version is meant to be used with v0.2.0 of the client side mod.",

      "description": "Additions\r\n- Goal Modes\r\n  - *All goal modes are requirements to unlock the final escape in Mount Horu*\r\n  - All Skill Trees: now includes picking up Kuro's Feather / Glide\r\n  - All Maps: place all mapstones around Nibel\r\n  - Warmth Fragments: collect the required amount of warmth fragments. Number of warmth fragments required/available is configurable\r\n  - World Tour: collect all relics from around Nibel. A configurable number of areas will be chosen to hold a relic in a random location within that area\r\n  - None: no other requirements\r\n- Horu lava room locations. These can be obtained by stopping the flow of lava in each of the eight Horu rooms. For purposes of hinting, these locations are named `HoruL1`, `HoruL2`, `HoruL3`, `HoruL4`, `HoruR1`, `HoruR2`, `HoruR3`, and `HoruR4`\r\n- Option for Extra Mapstones. Up to 9 additional mapstones can be added to the pool to make All Maps goal easier to complete\r\n- Item aliases for specific items for use in hinting\r\n  - `Glide` -> `KurosFeather`, `Grenade` -> `LightBurst`, `GinsoKey` -> `WaterVein`, `ForlornKey` -> `GumonSeal`, `HoruKey` -> `Sunstone`\r\n- New Mapstone Logic option: Progressive Mapstones. Locations are based on how many mapstones have been placed instead of specific mapstone locations. E.g. the first mapstone placed will always send `ProgressiveMap1` and the last will send `ProgressiveMap9`\r\n- Logic accessibility options to emulate the standalone Ori randomizer. This includes the ability to enable/disable the use of specific abilities and techniques for logic. This does not disable their use in-game, only whether they will be considered for logic generation. Some of these options may also only affect higher logic difficulties.\r\n  - Options: `Lure`, `Damage Boost`, `Double Bash`, `Grenade Jump`, `Air Dash`, `Charge Dash`, `Triple Jump`, and `Charge Flame Burn`\r\n\r\nFixes\r\n- Removed the requirement of `GinsoKey` and `ForlornKey` from many of the Ginso and Forlorn locations that are accessible from the teleporter\r\n- Open dungeon logic is now fixed, so the player can logically open keystone doors from the opposite direction\r\n- Fixed issue with filler items when using item links\r\n- Removed creation of oribf_world.puml as it was causing problems with some Linux users (and isn't necessary for the apworld to function)\r\n\r\nThis version is meant to be used with v0.3.0 of the client side mod.",

This affects standard and higher logic difficulty and is used specifically for the Ghost Lever trick in the Blackroot Burrows. (Fooling the game into thinking the lever is pulled by re-saving the game)\r\n    - An option to toggle this on/off has been added to the YAML options\r\n- Location Groups: Added location groups. Almost every location is in 2 groups, one for the general area its located in, and one for the \"item\" it normally gives the player (also includes locations like the breakable plants, or replacing the mapstones)\r\n    - Region Groups: Glades, Grove, Grotto, Blackroot, Swamp, Ginso, Horu, Valley, Forlorn, Sorrow, Misty\r\n    - Item Type Groups: ExpSmall, ExpMedium, ExpLarge, EnergyCell, HealthCell, AbilityCell, Keystone, Mapstone, Map, Skill, Plant, Event (triggering escapes and collecting story items), Cutscene (Horu lava room checks), ProgressiveMap\r\n\r\nFixes\r\n- Filler is now added dynamically so there is always a correct amount filler created/added. No more extra filler items at the end of generation\r\n\r\nThis version can be used with any 0.3.x version of the client side mod.",
