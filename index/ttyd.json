Shadow Queen goal now uses goal_stars to determine how many stars are needed to reach grodus.\r\n- Some small failsafes were added to chapter 2 in the case you did not get 101 punies in certain cases.\r\n- Some fast travel points were tweaked.\r\n- You will now properly be blocked from teleporting in chapter 5 if you just beat cortez and have not finished the intermission.\r\n- Some small text fixes and flag changes related to items.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n- Getting a crystal star from don pianta causes some of the music to play incorrectly.\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jamesbrq/ArchipelagoTTYD/compare/v0.5.3...v0.6.0",
