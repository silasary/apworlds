This is considered in beta for now and may be unstable as mod support for this game is still in active development. **Please read the setup page**, I've tried making setup as easy as possible but setup may still require a bit of work in some cases.\r\n\r\n### Here's the list of features:\r\n- Key Fragments, Characters, Refract Variants, Relics and Shop Restocks are randomized into the multiworld as important progression items.\r\n- Chester's shop in the hub sells 5 items, with each Shop Restock adding another 5.\r\n- Each character comes with an unique shop location per stage, as well as a run complete location.\r\n- Progression can be further gated using Progressive Dungeons.\r\n- Gems and Garbage act as the default filler and traps respectively.\r\n- Hats can be randomized into the multiworld for more chaos! Their behavior can be customized inside your YAML settings.\r\n- The stage and boss order can be randomized based on your Archipelago seed.\r\n- The amount of characters shuffled into the multiworld can be reduced to facilitate shorter Archipelago sessions.\r\n- Starting Relic items can be optionally shuffled into the multiworld, these give you a relic at the start of each run which helps with making Percy's cannon a more viable option for obtaining later checks.\r\n- Shops in-game can show which items are for sale!\r\n- Simple in-game location tracking.\r\n- YAMLess UT intergration.",

Due to some options fixes this release has an updated yaml.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- The client now has a page for Universal Tracker if the apworld is installed.\r\n- Tracker now supports UTs \"glitched logic\" feature, for checks that are reachable but considered out of logic due to a lack of relics.\r\n- \"Relic Leniency\" option works as intended now.\r\n- Including your starting character as an excluded character will raise an OptionError.\r\n- One too many shop restocks were being shuffled into the item pool.\r\n- Savedata backups now won't be able to override eachother.\r\n- Minor adjustment to the camp shop soft logic.",
