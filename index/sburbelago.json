      "description": "This release adds a bunch of options to customize your SBURB session.\r\n\r\nChoose whether the Medium is a true SBURB session, a ring, or a dual ring, whether the order of players is randomized, and whether only progression items are subject to these rules(helps with generating consistently).\r\n\r\nYou can now also add worlds to Skaia, the centerpoint of the session. These worlds will have the ability to send and receive any items to/from all players, making it possible to play otherwise extremely restrictive games for the SBURB structure, like a central bingo or a few Cliques for fun.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: To be able to clean up after itself and not show up on the uploaded multiworld as a perpetually non-goaled empty slot, this meta world now requires itself to be the final slot in the world. Rename the yaml accordingly.",
