      "description": "**Update**: Archipelago 0.6.4 has gone live, it is now the preferred way to play this apworld.\r\n\r\nA downloadable apworld containing planned 0.6.4 content and cherry-picked bugfixes. Download the sc2.apworld file (ignore the source code downloads, those are out-of-date).\r\nCheck out the changelog [here](https://github.com/MatthewMarinets/ap_sc2_notes/blob/main/changelog.md).\r\n\r\nAfter installing the apworld, you can generate a template yaml by running the Archipelago launcher and selecting \"Generate Template Settings\". Move the templates you want into the base Players/ folder and remove the rest. When you're ready to generate a game, run ArchipelagoGenerate.exe, and upload the resulting file from the output/ folder to https://archipelago.gg/uploads.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n* This .apworld _replaces_ the one in lib/worlds/; the live version should be removed and replaced with this one\r\n* Because this .apworld and the live version conflict, a multiworld does not support both versions at the same time. Either all players play beta or all players play live\r\n* This .apworld will not work with ArchipelagoStarcraft2Client.exe; launch the client by launching the general Archipelago launcher and searching for the starcraft 2 client from there\r\n  * **Known issue**: There will be two copies of the starcraft 2 client in the launcher list; both should work the same. This is a byproduct of pasting an .apworld on an older install, and will be fixed automatically when upgrading to Archipelago 0.6.4\r\n\r\nThe custom mission order documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/blob/main/worlds/sc2/docs/custom_mission_orders_en.md). Unfortunately it doesn't get hosted by archipelago.gg until they do their next version release.",
