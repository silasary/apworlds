When opened it will show you how many items you have received and how many you have not. It also breaks the items up into their different groups.\r\n\r\n* Visible Hint Locations. - Adds a border around an upgrade node when an item was hinted for that location.\r\n\r\n### New Randomization Options.\r\n* Boss Drops. - Boss drops are now able to be added to the itempool. when you defeat a boss for the first time instead of giving a core it will instead give a randomized item.\r\n\r\n* CryptoMine Levels. - Inside the CryptoMine menu you are able to upgrade the speed of which the cryptomine will convert bits to netcoins. This option when enabled will randomize those said levels.\r\n\r\n* Progressive Items. - The Rate at which the game scales felt a little off. so with this setting enabled instead of being able to get high levels of upgrades early you will instead upgrade them progressively.\r\n\r\n* Death Link actually works!\r\n\r\n* Every Goal Works.\r\n\r\n### And More!\r\n* Better APWorld Rules to better prevent softlocks. (some settings may cause these rules to not work properly although I have not had a problem yet)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
