Please do not use this APWorld to connect to games generated on that version.\r\n\r\n- Bugfixes\r\n  - Fixed an error where bringing Cloud to the Altima fight would cause undesired behavior.\r\n  - Fixed a logic bug where Fovoham was accessible without the Fovoham Pass.\r\n- Changes\r\n  - Zodiac Stones are now named \"[Stone Name] Stone\" for easier searching on the web tracker.\r\n  - Locations have been added corresponding to the Zodiac Stone reward locations in vanilla.\r\n    - As two stones are received in vanilla after Limberry Castle Cemetery, that location will have two Zodiac Stone reward slots.\r\n  - In accordance with the above change, the Vanilla Stones option for Zodiac Stone placement will place Zodiac Stones into these slots.\r\n    - Going along with this, Inside Limberry Castle will no longer be eligible to have a Zodiac Stone as its location has been moved to its \"proper\" spot at Limberry Castle Cemetery.\r\n  - The client will now sync up found locations with the location dots on the world map as opposed to the dot color being based purely on local state.\r\n    - In other words, if all locations at Mandalia Plains have been found in the MW, whether through your own actions or through a multiworld Collect, the dot will turn green, even if on your current save you haven't cleared all locations at Mandalia Plains.\r\n    - Due to technical limitations, this will only update after returning from a battle or loading a save game.",
