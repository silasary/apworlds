Adds around 260 checks, or around 300 with entrance rando.\r\n\r\n### Tunic apworld/Archipelago changes:\r\n- Added Breakable Shuffle to AP\r\n- The Torch can now be added to start_inventory in your yaml file\r\n- Hexagon Quest ability thresholds are now listed in the AP-generated spoiler log\r\n- Renamed the `grass_fill` option to `local_fill`, which can now be used even if grass rando is turned off.\r\n  - If breakable shuffle is on, this will default to 40 if left default. Grass rando still defaults to 95.\r\n  - Reduced max local fill value from 100 to 98 to avoid possible fill errors when set to 100.\r\n- Various logic fixes, etc\r\n- The world/yaml settings that are displayed when connecting to an AP game can now be hidden.\r\n- Updated Archipelago.MulitClient.Net to the latest version (6.5.0)\r\n\r\n### Entrance Tracker File\r\n- The rando now populates a file (.csv format) as you play showing the entrances you've gone through and where they connect.\r\n- You can find it under Randomizer Settings -> Hint Settings -> Open Entrance Tracker\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes\r\n- Addressed an issue when entering AP connection info where the main menu buttons would become unresponsive.\r\n- Fixed certain parts of the title screen windows being cutoff on steam deck & lower resolutions.\r\n- Fixed an issue in enemy rando where the East Forest boss hp bar could become stuck on screen after leaving the room.\r\n- Fixed a few spots where turrets could spawn and block the player in enemy rando.\r\n- The shotgun will no longer inflict self damage when the fox is tiny.\r\n- Addressed some issues with the fairy seeking spell.\r\n- Arachnophobia mode now applies to the enemies thrown out by boss scavenger (enemy rando).\r\n- Added a toggle under Other Settings to stop the game from running in background",

(Ex. Finding the fuse outside of the Cathedral will not immediately open the Cathedral unless the other two Swamp fuses have also been found)\r\n  - Praying at a fuse will instead count as a check, and does not affect the power. Fuses that are not the first in a sequence of fuses still require power from finding the fuse items in order to activate their checks,\r\n- With this mode, certain areas can become logically accessible in ways they couldn't before, such as entering Ziggurat or Library via the teleporters, or entering Cathedral without Laurels or Prayer.\r\n\r\n## Shuffle Bells\r\n- Turns the East and West Bells into items that must be found in order to open the Sealed Temple. Ringing the bells counts as checks.\r\n\r\n## Archipelago Updates\r\n### Trap Link (by @ScipioWright)\r\n- Send a trap back to other players when you receive a Fool Trap. Anyone else that is playing at the same time with Trap Link enabled will receive the same trap as the player who sent it (or a similar trap where applicable if not playing Tunic).\r\n\r\n### tunic.apworld changes\r\n- Added the options for shuffled fuses and shuffled bells to the apworld/yaml.\r\n- Various logic bugfixes.\r\n\r\n### Archipelago-specific fixes\r\n- Coin toss checks done while disconnected from Archipelago will now be marked to send on next reconnect.\r\n- Fixed a bug where siege engine would get stuck during the death cutscene if the item on his head was already collected.\r\n- Previously processed items are now skipped instantly when re-connecting to an in progress Archipelago save.\r\n  - This was mostly only noticeable with grass rando, where it would sometimes take a long time to start receiving items again after loading into the game.\r\n- Updated Archipelago.MultiClient.Net to 6.6.0\r\n \r\n## Enemy Randomizer Updates\r\n### Random Enemy Sizes\r\n- Randomly scales enemy size up or down (from 0.25x to 1.75x).\r\n- This option is global and works regardless of if the enemy rando is enabled or not.\r\n\r\n### Extra Enemies\r\n- The \"Extra Enemies\" option is now global and works even if randomized enemies are disabled. If enemies aren't randomized it will enable NG+ and nighttime enemies that appear throughout the game.\r\n\r\n## Misc Changes\r\n- Interacting with The Heir for the first time with all pages will now prompt you to choose an ending, instead of forcing the good ending.\r\n- Added a new fool trap type \ud83d\udd04\r\n- Gave Terry a hat on his birthday \ud83c\udf89\r\n- Another thing in a place somewhere probably\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n- The game may sometimes crash immediately upon defeating The Heir. There currently isn't a known cause or fix for this.\r\n- Single Player Entrance Randomizer may produce unbeatable seeds",
