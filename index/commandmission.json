If the teleport \"access granted\" patching does not work... Save your game and reload your save to fix this! \r\n\r\n- Chapter 2 bugs should now be very few and far between. Report any you might find! \r\n\r\n- Chapter 6 items should now be working properly. No more writing from vanilla - especially for pickaxes, booster parts, and Electric Components. \r\n\r\n- Reduced item #s to prevent the check lockout. If this persists, its an easy fix so report if it happens! \r\n\r\nQOL:\r\n- Green Blockers in chapter 7 for items on the top level have been removed. \r\n- CHAPTER 9 LASERS ARE FIXED. You will now only have to fight each laser once... and they should stay yellow. Plus, all doors in Chapter 9 are unlocked for more ease of access. \r\n\r\nFor Next Release:\r\n- Still digging into more Level/power scaling so we can bring back the tails clan, and rafflesian. Plus this would alleviate the going to chapter 9 first issue / difficulty. \r\n\r\n- I will start to look at the chapter 5 alarm. I can currently turn it off, but the reploids block exits. ",

The code will now correctly check for 9 medals and the Far East HQ Access Code to open the door permanently. Previously, this was resetting on Save and Quit... but it shouldnt have any matter now. \r\n\r\nQOL:\r\n- Door before Central Tower Key Door is permanently unlocked.\r\n- Some barriers have been removed to allow access to a further Treasure Token location in Chapter 2. \r\n\r\nWIP:\r\n- Treasure Tokens added as location options. (Currently up to Chapter 4 is done, but not implemented). \r\n\r\nFor Next Few Releases:\r\n1) Complete the Treasure Token Locations and set them as options for the YAML. \r\n(After these are working, then its time for ALL the sky room cosmetics.) \r\n\r\n- Still digging into more Level/power scaling so we can bring back the tails clan, and rafflesian. Plus this would alleviate the going to chapter 9 first issue / difficulty. \r\n\r\n- Looking into Item shop stuff to possibly include shop sanity in the future. \r\n\r\n- More QoL: Like Chapter 5 Alarm. A potential warp reset from anywhere, etc. \r\n\r\n",

Make sure to put this in your players folder!\r\n\r\n## Make sure to report any issues in the Discord Channel in the Archipelago server! \r\n\r\n## WARNING: You MUST connect the client to the Archipelago server immediately before loading ANY patched MMX Command Mission rom! Failure to do so will cause many bugs and issues.\r\n---This is becoming less and less prevalent as more releases come out: eventually this will not be necessary!\r\n\r\nSee this file for ALL Instructions regarding this randomizer, as well as win condition and what is randomized:\r\nhttps://github.com/themogulAP/ArchipelagoCM/blob/main/worlds/commandmission/docs/en_Mega%20Man%20X%20Command%20Mission%20Instructions.md\r\n\r\nSee this file for ALL Setup required for setting up and playing this Archipelago!\r\nhttps://github.com/themogulAP/ArchipelagoCM/blob/main/worlds/commandmission/docs/setup_en.md\r\n\r\n\r\nKNOWN ISSUES:\r\n\r\nUpon defeating Chapter 2 boss: Wild Jango as the 2nd - 9th boss: this will cause NPCs and other characters to turn red.\r\n(This is fixed by re-entering the helipad location in Central Tower).\r\nYou can also fix this by saving and reloading your game!\r\n\r\nNames for items received will be vanilla in game: But they WILL show up as the randomized item in their respective inventory...\r\nI.e. X Buster will automatically be in the weapons tab, Build Power will be in consumable tab, etc.\r\n\r\nNEW CONTENT:\r\n-All Characters are now Randomized in game! You can now start with whatever character you want... and they will NEVER leave the party! \r\nIn the future: there will be random functionality in the YAML. \r\n\r\nAn example YAML has been provided with it set to Cinnamon.... using the \"generate template options\" in the launcher will default back to X! \r\n\r\n## CHANGES:\r\n- FIXED Teleport Issues - This should be less and less of an issue as time progresses. If the teleport \"access granted\" patching does not work... Save your game and reload your save to fix this! \r\n\r\n- Chapter 2 bugs should now be very few and far between. Report any you might find! \r\n\r\n- Mechaniloid Items are now fixed properly: there should be no more shenanigans with writing the vanilla item to inventory, or funky save reloading! \r\n\r\n- Chapter 6 items should now be working properly. No more writing from vanilla - especially for pickaxes, booster parts, and Electric Components. \r\n\r\n- Queen of Clubs was set to the wrong ID... now fixed to display the right weapon! \r\n\r\n- \"Fake\" Central Key has been fixed and will now only give to the player at the AP-inspired location. \r\n\r\n- Fixed potential issues with runs being stuck due to the Keys: Lagrano, Melda, etc. \r\n\r\n- Reduced item #s to prevent the check lockout. If this persists, its an easy fix so report if it happens! \r\n\r\nQOL:\r\n- Green Blockers in chapter 7 for items on the top level have been removed. \r\n- CHAPTER 9 LASERS ARE FIXED. You will now only have to fight each laser once... and they should stay yellow. Plus, all doors in Chapter 9 are unlocked for more ease of access. \r\n\r\nFor Next Release:\r\n- Still digging into more Level/power scaling so we can bring back the tails clan, and rafflesian. Plus this would alleviate the going to chapter 9 first issue / difficulty. \r\n\r\n- I will start to look at the chapter 5 alarm. I can currently turn it off, but the reploids block exits. ",

This will prevent any further softlocking shenanigans from happening. \r\n\r\n- ENCOUNTER RATE OFF is now completely fixed! Choosing this YAML option will now permanently remove all random encounters. \r\n(The option for lower and higher is still being worked out!) \r\n\r\n- Reduced item #s further to prevent the check lockout. If this persists, its an easy fix so report if it happens! \r\n\r\nWIP:\r\n- Treasure Tokens are complete up to the start of Gaudile Laboratory.
