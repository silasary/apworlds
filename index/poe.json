This world randomizes base item types as location checks, allowing you to unlock gear, flask slots, support gem links, character classes, and ascendancies as you progress through the game.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n### Core Gameplay\r\n\r\n- **Base Item Hunt**: Find specific base item types to check locations in your multiworld  \r\n- **Character Progression**: Unlock new character classes and ascendancies through items  \r\n- **Gear Unlocks**: Unlock better gear rarities (Normal, Magic, Rare, Unique)  \r\n- **Flask Slot Upgrades**: Expand your flask capacity through progression items  \r\n- **Support Gem Links**: Unlock additional gem socket links for more power  \r\n\r\n### Audio Integration\r\n\r\n- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Automatically generates audio cues for item discoveries  \r\n- **Custom Item Filter**: Dynamic filter generation with sound alerts for unchecked locations  \r\n- **Player Name Integration**: TTS announces which player's item you've found  \r\n\r\n### OAuth Integration\r\n\r\n- **GGG API Authentication**: Secure login to Path of Exile's official API  \r\n- **Character Validation**: Automatic verification of your character's inventory and equipment  \r\n- **Real-time Updates**: Syncs your in-game progress with the Archipelago server  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Installation & Setup\r\n\r\n1.

Profit!\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Client Commands\r\n\r\nThe Path of Exile client provides several commands accessible through the Archipelago interface:\r\n\r\n### Essential Setup Commands\r\n\r\n#### `/set_client_text_path <path>`\r\n\r\n- Sets the path to your Path of Exile client log file  \r\n- Run this **after connecting, before launching** `/start_poe`  \r\n- Wrap the path in quotes: `\"<PATH>\"`  \r\n\r\n**Common paths**:\r\n```\r\nC:/Program Files (x86)/Grinding Gear Games/Path of Exile/logs/Client.txt  \r\nC:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Path of Exile/logs/Client.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Example**:\r\n```\r\n/set_client_text_path \"C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Path of Exile/logs/Client.txt\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### `/char_name <character_name>`\r\n\r\n- Sets your current character name for tracking  \r\n- Used for API validation and progress tracking  \r\n- Alternative: Type `!ap char` in-game to set automatically  \r\n\r\n**Example**:\r\n```\r\n/poe_char_name \"MyCharacterName\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### `/poe_base_item_filter <filter_name>`\r\n\r\n- Sets your base item filter file (optional)  \r\n- Must be a local `.filter` file in your Path of Exile folder  (C:\\Users\\<USER>\\Documents\\My Games\\Path of Exile)\r\n- The Archipelago filter will be layered on top of this  \r\n\r\n**Example**:\r\n```bash\r\n/poe_base_item_filter \"MyFilter.filter\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Utility Commands\r\n\r\n#### `/poe_auth`\r\n\r\n- Authenticate with Path of Exile's OAuth2 service  \r\n- Opens a browser window for secure login  \r\n- Required for API features and character validation  \r\n- Tokens are automatically saved and refreshed  \r\n\r\n#### `/start_poe`\r\n\r\n- Starts the Path of Exile client integration  \r\n- Begins monitoring your client log file  \r\n- Activates item filter generation  \r\n- Enables automatic progress tracking  \r\n- **Prerequisite**: Must set client text path first  \r\n\r\n#### `/poe_generate_tts`\r\n\r\n- Manually generates TTS audio files for missing locations  \r\n- Useful if TTS generation fails automatically  \r\n- Files saved to: `Documents/My Games/Path of Exile/apsound/`  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Configuration Options\r\n\r\n### Character Options\r\n\r\n- **Starting Character**: Choose your initial character class (Marauder, Ranger, Witch, etc.)  \r\n- **Allow Other Characters**: Whether you can unlock additional character classes  \r\n- **Ascendancies per Class**: Number of ascendancy options available for each class  \r\n\r\n### Progression Options\r\n\r\n- **Gear Unlocks**: Enable/disable gear rarity progression  \r\n- **Flask Slot Upgrades**: Enable/disable flask capacity progression  \r\n- **Support Gem Slots**: Enable/disable gem link progression  \r\n- **Gucci Hobo Mode**: Restricts gear quality (1 Normal Item and any Unique, 1 Item of Any rarity, or only uniques)  \r\n\r\n### Audio Options\r\n\r\n- **Enable TTS**: Turn text-to-speech on/off *(Unimplemented)*  \r\n- **TTS Speed**: Adjust speech rate (words per minute) *(Unimplemented)*  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## How It Works\r\n\r\n### Location Checking\r\n\r\n- The client monitors your Path of Exile log file for zone changes  \r\n- When you enter a new area, it validates your character via the GGG API  \r\n- Your inventory and equipment are checked for base item types  \r\n- Any new base items found trigger location checks in Archipelago  \r\n- The item filter updates to remove found items and highlight remaining ones  \r\n\r\n### Item Filter Generation\r\n\r\n- Automatically creates `__ap.filter` in your Path of Exile folder  \r\n- Highlights unchecked base item types with custom colors and sounds  \r\n- Integrates with your existing item filter as an overlay  \r\n- Updates in real-time as you find items  \r\n\r\n### TTS Integration\r\n\r\n- Generates unique audio files for each missing item  \r\n- Announces the player name and item when found  \r\n- Files are cached to avoid regeneration  \r\n- Integrates with the item filter for audio cues  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# In-Game Whisper Commands\r\n\r\nOnce connected, you can whisper yourself in Path of Exile to query your received items. All commands must be sent as whispers to your own character (using `@YourCharacterName` in chat):\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Character Setup\r\n\r\n### `!ap char`\r\n\r\n- Sets your character name automatically  \r\n- Generates a unique verification code  \r\n- Confirms your character identity with the client  \r\n- Must be used before other whisper commands work  \r\n\r\n**Usage**: Type `!ap char` in global chat (not as a whisper)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Item Query Commands\r\n\r\n### `!main gems` / `!gems`\r\n\r\n- Lists all main skill gems you've received  \r\n- Shows active skill gems available to use  \r\n- Sorted by required level (highest first)  \r\n- **Example output**: `Fireball, Ice Nova, Lightning Bolt`\r\n\r\n### `!support gems`\r\n\r\n- Lists all support gems you've received  \r\n- Shows gems that modify active skills  \r\n- Includes damage, utility, and defensive supports  \r\n- **Example output**: `Melee Physical Damage Support, Added Fire Damage Support`\r\n\r\n### `!utility gems`\r\n\r\n- Lists all utility skill gems you've received  \r\n- Shows auras, curses, movement skills, and other utility gems  \r\n- **Example output**: `Clarity, Anger, Leap Slam`\r\n\r\n### `!all gems` / `!gems`\r\n\r\n- Lists all gem types you've received  \r\n- Combines main, support, and utility gems  \r\n- Comprehensive list of all available gems\r\n- This may be hard to make sense of at the moment\r\n\r\n### `!gear`\r\n\r\n- Lists all gear items you've received  \r\n- Shows unlocked equipment types  \r\n- Includes weapons, armor, and accessories  \r\n\r\n### `!weapons`\r\n\r\n- Lists all weapon items you've received  \r\n- Shows all unlocked weapon types  \r\n- Includes melee, ranged, and caster weapons  \r\n\r\n### `!armor`\r\n\r\n- Lists all armor items you've received  \r\n- Shows all unlocked armor pieces  \r\n- Includes helmets, body armor, gloves, boots, and shields  \r\n\r\n### `!links`\r\n\r\n- Lists all gem link upgrades you've received  \r\n- Shows maximum socket link configurations unlocked  \r\n\r\n### `!flasks`\r\n\r\n- Lists all flask items you've received  \r\n- Includes flask slot upgrades  \r\n\r\n### `!ascendancy`\r\n\r\n- Lists all ascendancy classes you've received  \r\n- Shows unlocked specialization classes  \r\n- **Example output**: `Juggernaut, Berserker, Chieftain`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Usage Tips\r\n\r\n- All whisper commands require you to have set your character name first with `!ap char`  \r\n- Commands are case-sensitive and must include the `!` prefix  \r\n- Whisper yourself using `@YourCharacterName` command in chat  \r\n- The client will respond with the requested information via whisper  \r\n- This only whispers 500 characters (max whisper size in PoE), so after a bit the lists won't be useful anymore :(\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Technical Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Path of Exile**: Compatible with current game version  \r\n- **Python 3.8+**: Required for Archipelago client  \r\n- **Internet Connection**: Needed for GGG API authentication  \r\n- **Windows**: Primary platform (others may work but untested)  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting\r\n\r\n### Common Issues\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Item filter not updating\r\n\r\n- Ensure client text path is set correctly  \r\n- Verify the log file is being written to by Path of Exile  \r\n- Check that you have write permissions to your Path of Exile folder  \r\n\r\n#### Authentication failing\r\n\r\n- Run `/poe_auth` to refresh your OAuth token  \r\n- Ensure you're logged into the correct Path of Exile account  \r\n- Check your internet connection  \r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n\r\n\r\n- Connecting to wrong slot / player name will cause the client to crash\r\n- Silently fails on bad client.txt path\r\n- Make sure client.txt path is a file, not just a directory\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nThis world integrates with Path of Exile's official API and follows GGG's terms of service for third-party applications. The TTS system uses Windows Speech Platform for audio generation.\r\n",

      "description": "# Path of Exile (PC)\r\n\r\n\r\n## What does randomization do to this game?\r\n\r\nThis `.apworld` does not modify Path of Exile directly, it:\r\n- Reads your character data through an API.\r\n- Reads your PoE client logs.\r\n- Writes to an item filter (and can place audio files) to highlight AP items.\r\n- Checks that you are using the items / gems that you have received. And sends checks when you find new items or level up.\r\n\r\n## What items and locations get shuffled?\r\n\r\n### Locations (checks)\r\n- Finding certain base item types that drop from monsters (e.g., a specific sword base).\r\n- Leveling up.\r\n\r\n### Items (unlocks)\r\n- Available characters\r\n- Ascendancies\r\n- Passive skill points\r\n- Ability to equip certain gear rarities\r\n- Ability to equip flasks\r\n- Maximum allowed number of linked sockets\r\n- Utility gems (auras, movement skills, curses, etc.)\r\n- Skill gems (active attack/spell abilities)\r\n- Support gems (that empower skill gems)\r\n\r\n\r\n## How It Works (Read-Only Integration)\r\n\r\n### Core loop\r\n1. **Enter a zone** \u2192 the client validates your current gear and progression.\r\n2. **Pick up items** \u2192 The filter should make clear what items will unlock things.\r\n3. **Enter a new zone** \u2192 \u201cchecks\u201d are sent for newly found items/conditions.\r\n\r\n## What does another world's item look like in Path of Exile?\r\n- Items from other players will be highlighted in your item filter.\r\n- If enabled there will be audio cues for what an item will unlock when you pick it up and change zones.\r\n\r\n## Options\r\n\r\n### Configurable goals\r\n- Finish acts / complete the campaign\r\n- Kill endgame bosses\r\n\r\n### Configurable Items\r\n\r\n**Characters & Classes:**\r\n- Starting character class (Marauder, Ranger, Witch, Duelist, Templar, Shadow, Scion)\r\n- Additional character unlocks (optional)\r\n- Ascendancy classes (0-3 per character class)\r\n\r\n**Equipment & Gear:**\r\n- Gear rarity restrictions (Normal, Magic, Rare, Unique)\r\n- Starting gear allowances (weapon, flask slots, gems)\r\n- Flask slot upgrades (up to 5 total)\r\n- Support gem socket limits (linked sockets for gem combinations)\r\n\r\n**Skills & Progression:**\r\n- Passive skill points (can be restricted and unlocked through items)\r\n- Skill gems (active attack/spell abilities)\r\n- Support gems (enhance and modify skill gems)  \r\n- Utility gems (auras, movement skills, curses, buffs)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Quality of Life:**\r\n- Text-to-Speech announcements for found items\r\n- Configurable TTS speed (50-500 WPM)\r\n- DeathLink integration (share deaths with other players)\r\n\r\n**Item Distribution:**\r\n- Minimum items per act (ensures progression isn't completely blocked)\r\n- Gear upgrades, flask slots, and support gem slots distributed per act\r\n- Skill gem availability scaling with acts\r\n\r\n**Misc:**\r\n- Gucci Hobo Mode (extreme equipment restrictions - unique items only) -- Would not recommend.\r\n\r\n---\r\nExample options:\r\nI want to use my own end-game character, and go from nothing to mapping to a boss.\r\n- Disable levels as checks.\r\n- Enable passive skill points as unlocks.\r\n- Respec my character, removing all passive points, and start with no gear.\r\n- enable boss as a goal\r\n- add my class in the \"starting inventory\" section.\r\n  ```\r\n    start_inventory:\r\n    # Start with these items.\r\n    {\r\n      \"Ascendant\": 1,\r\n    }\r\n--- \r\n## What do I do if I encounter a bug with the game?\r\n- Please reach out to the discord chanel for Path of Exile archipelago\r\n#### OR\r\n- Create an issue here: https://github.com/stubobis1/Archipelago/issues\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Path of Exile Archipelago Setup Guide\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 1) Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- Path of Exile installed and playable.\r\n- Python 3.12 installed. (Python 3.13 will not work)\r\n- Archipelago (latest release).\r\n- The Path of Exile `.apworld` file from the Path of Exile APWorld release page. (https://github.com/stubobis1/Archipelago/releases)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 2) Download & Install Archipelago\r\n\r\n1. Download the latest Archipelago release:\r\n   - https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases\r\n2. Install Python if needed:\r\n   - https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31210/\r\n3. Extract the Archipelago release to a folder of your choice (e.g., `C:\\Games\\Archipelago` or `~/Archipelago`).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 3) Add the Path of Exile `.apworld`\r\n\r\n1. Download the `.apworld`:\r\n   - https://github.com/stubobis1/Archipelago/releases\r\n2. Place the `.apworld` file into the `Archipelago/custom_worlds/` folder.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 4) Generate / Join a Multiworld\r\n\r\n1. Launch `ArchipelagoLauncher.exe` from your Archipelago folder.\r\n2. Generate Template Options\r\n3. Modify `Archipelago/Players/Templates/Path of Exile.yaml` to change options to your liking.\r\n4. Setup a Multiworld session:\r\n  - If self-hosting / playing single player:\r\n    - place the `Path of Exile.yaml` in your Players directory\r\n    - run `ArchipelagoLauncher.exe`\r\n    - Select **Generate Game**.\r\n    - Select **Host**, and select the generated file from `/output`\r\n    - By default the server will run on port `38281`\r\n  - If playing with others:\r\n    - Send your `yaml` to whomever is generating and hosting\r\n    - Get your slot name from the host, and the server address (IP or domain) and port.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 5) Setup Poptracker (Optional but Highly Recommended)\r\n\r\n1. Download Poptracker from: https://github.com/black-sliver/PopTracker/releases\r\n2. Extract / Setup Poptracker to a folder of your choice.\r\n3. Download the PoE Archipelago Poptracker pack from: https://github.com/stubobis1/PathOfExilePoptracker/releases\r\n4. Place the zip file into the `poptracker/packs` directory.\r\n5. Launch `PopTracker.exe`.\r\n6. Click on the `AP` button at the top.\r\n7. Enter your slot name and server address from step 4. (Example: `127.0.0.1:38281`, slot `Player1`, no password)\r\n8. If the `AP` button is green you are connected.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 6) Start the Client\r\n\r\n1. In `ArchipelagoLauncher.exe` run `Path of Exile` from the client list.\r\n2. Enter the slot name and server address in the top bar \r\n   - something like `Player1:@127.0.0.1:38281` \r\n     - (note the `:` after the slot name is where you would put the password, if one was set by the host).\r\n3. Click **Connect**.\r\n4. (optional) Run `/received` to see which class you have received. (not needed if you setup poptracker)\r\n5. Run `/poe_auth` in the client console to authenticate your PoE account.\r\n6. Set the character you will be playing with `/char YourCharacterName`.\r\n7. Set your `client.txt` path by running `/client \"C:\\PathOfExile\\logs\\Client.txt\"` (adjust path as needed). Note the Quotation marks.\r\n8. Set your item filter path by running `/filter <filterName>.filter` \r\n    - this should be a local filter, and exist at something like `C:\\Users\\<USERNAME>\\Documents\\My Games\\Path of Exile`\r\n9. (Optional) Enable or Disable DeathLink with `/deathlink` if you want to share deaths with other players.\r\n10. If you haven't already, Launch Path of Exile and **LOGIN**. \r\n11. Run `/start` in the client console and enjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n## 7) In\u2011Game Chat Commands (Whisper Yourself)\r\n\r\nSend whispers **to your own character** using `@YourCharacterName` followed by a command. Example:\r\n```\r\n@YourCharacterName !gems\r\n```\r\n\r\nCommands:\r\n```\r\n!ap char                  - Set your character\r\n!deathlink                - Toggle DeathLink\r\n!goal                     - View your current goal\r\n!passive or !p            - List usable passive points\r\n!usable skill gems        - List usable skill gems (by level)\r\n!usable support gems      - List usable support gems\r\n!usable utility gems      - List usable utility gems\r\n!usable gems              - List all usable gems\r\n!main gems                - Show main skill gems received\r\n!support gems             - Show support gems received\r\n!utility gems             - Show utility gems received\r\n!all gems or !gems        - Show all gems received\r\n!gear                     - Show usable gear\r\n!weapons                  - Show usable weapons\r\n!armor                    - Show usable armor\r\n!links                    - Show maximum link allowance\r\n!flasks                   - Show flask unlocks\r\n!ascendancy               - Show unlocked ascendancies\r\n!help                     - Show help message\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: Commands must be whispered to **yourself** (not global chat) using `@YourCharacterName`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 8) Tips & Troubleshooting\r\n\r\n- Keep the Archipelago client running while you play PoE.\r\n- If you pick up an item and no check is sent, **enter a new zone** to trigger a check.\r\n- Make sure your PoE logs are being read (client should detect zone changes and chat whispers).\r\n- If the item filter isn\u2019t changing, run `/filter` in the client console.\r\n- DeathLink: When enabled, your deaths (and others\u2019) can be shared as events across players.\r\n- OAuth/API: Ensure your PoE account is properly authenticated if the client needs character data from the API.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 9) Quick Start Summary\r\n\r\n1. Install Python (3.12) and Archipelago.\r\n2. Drop the PoE `.apworld` into `Archipelago/custom_worlds/`.\r\n3. Use the Launcher to generate or connect to a multiworld.\r\n4. Start playing PoE with the client open.\r\n5. Whisper yourself for status/info commands and change zones to send checks.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHappy mapping, and good luck with your drops!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(patch notes)\r\n- added `!goal`\r\n- fixed `!flasks`\r\n- fixed max links for gloves and boots\r\n- Fixed error on startup, better handling of socket errors\r\n- stopped opening up 1 billion webpages for auth.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
