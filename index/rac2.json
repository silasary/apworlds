      "description": "## Changes\r\n- Big code refactor on the back end. This will make it easier for me to focus on new features going forward. I'm sure this will have both created and solved bugs that I didn't catch, so let me know if you notice anything unusual.\r\n- Added in-game message when sending items to other players.\r\n- Setting `iso_start` in `host.yaml` to a file path will cause PCSX2 to start with the `-batch` flag.\r\n- `Hrugis`, `Gorn` and `Damosel` are no longer eligible starting planets. (I might add a hard mode option for starting planets back later)\r\n- I now distribute a simplified version of the options yaml. For the full weighted version, use `Generate Templates`.\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n- The refactor should fix any `StrEnum` related incompatibilities with other games\r\n- Some minor logic fixes snuck their way into the big refactor.\r\n- Tried to fix black screen that can occur if a death is queued when landing on a planet. (You could get out of this by resetting to ship shack but it caused the ship to go \"SCP Mode\")\r\n- Spiderbot Glove now only appears as part of the multiworld item pool and not in the shop.\r\n- Fix forced spawn at Glider course on `Tabora`\r\n- Fix forced spawn at Hypnotist on `Damosel`\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/evilwb/APRac2/compare/v0.4.0...v0.4.1\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n- Lots of weird edge cases with Deathlink. I would consider this an unstable feature still.\r\n- The taxi near the Hypnotist on `Damosel` may not arrive when it should.\r\n- Some of the `Hypnomatic Part` locations still give their original popup message.\r\n\r\n# Docs #\r\nFor more info on what this randomizer does, take a look at the [readme](https://github.com/evilwb/APRac2/blob/main/README.md).\r\nPlease take a look at the full [setup guide](https://github.com/evilwb/APRac2/blob/main/docs/setup_en.md) to get started.\r\nThere's also an excellent [setup video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRCuEQVgzPE) by [Scyker](https://www.youtube.com/@scyker).\r\n\r\n# Supported Game Version\r\nThis only works with the following version of the game for now:\r\n    - Platform: `Playstation 2` (This project will not be tackling the Playstation 3 versions)\r\n    - Version: `1.01`\r\n    - Serial: `SCUS-97268`\r\n    - CRC: `38996035`\r\n    - MD5: `3cbbb5127ee8a0be93ef0876f7781ee8`\r\n\r\nThere is rooms for other versions/regions to be added in the future.\r\n\r\n# Basic Setup\r\n## AP World Installation\r\n\r\n1.
