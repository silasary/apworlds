Known levels are banned from spawning a Backup DK Barrel. Please report those if you manage to find spots like this one.\r\n* Map icons for Boss Levels sometimes won't be properly marked as beaten.\r\n* Sometimes beating K. Rool will pop you back to the main menu. You can still get the \"Goal Completed\" flag to be set if you visit the Banana Hoard in Kongo Jungle.\r\n* Torchlight Trouble grants Squawks when starting from the checkpoint or exiting the bonus.\r\n* A few levels won't send their Clear check until you enter another level\r\n* Credits can get messed up with traps\r\n",
