Made it so enemies never contain locations and instead they teleport to where the enemy is when they are slain.  Enemy health at ops and after buffed.

Various other fixes.\r\n\r\nAdded new default on option to remove 596 locations, about half of them, with the same name as another location or very close to another location to make the amount of locations a bit more reasonable.  This option removes all filler audio logs, reduces some weapon counts, and compresses items like hypos, nanites, ammo, and cyber modules so that there are less items in the pool but increases the amount you get with each item to maintain the same overall count.  Paladin of Tyr from the archipelago discord did the majority of the work on this option so credit to them.",
