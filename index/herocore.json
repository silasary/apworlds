I recommend not bringing this prerelease version to any Syncs or Asyncs where this may be a problem. In this prerelease version, you can press the K key to toggle invincibility in case you need it for some reason. This feature will be removed in the official v1.0.0 release.",

      "description": "- The build is stable enough that I feel comfortable marking this as a full release instead of a prelease (Sorry it took a couple months lol)\r\n- Moved the narrow passage under the Barrier Generator in Core on Hard mode so that the generator can be destroyed if the nearby barrier is down but the doors leading to it aren't open yet.\r\n- Added a barrier to the right side of the room below Star Splitter boss room in Normal mode, to discourage moving to the room with the Barrier Generator before the barrier is down, which would result in spawning on top of a barrier and immediately dying.\r\n- Battle Doors now only become disabled when approaching them from behind (If you have the corresponding Battle Door item). They will behave normally when entering from the intended entrance.\r\n- Certain Barrier Generators will become disabled when entering their room from behind the Generator.\r\n- Saving the game after defeating Eliminator now remembers that you defeated Eliminator\r\n- Increased the odds that Eliminator will spawn when you are at Level 9 or higher.\r\n- Removed the hotkey to turn invincibility on.\r\n- Fixed a few location names in maps.json that resulted in those locations not showing up on the internal map tracker.",
