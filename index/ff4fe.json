Put the APWorld in your AP custom worlds directory.\r\n2. Use the launcher's Generate Template YAMLs button to create a template YAML file, and edit it as you desire.\r\n3. Give your YAML to whoever is generating. You'll get back a .apff4fe file from the generation.\r\n4. Install the latest Free Enterprise for AP release from [here](https://github.com/Rosalie-A/FreeEnterprise4/releases/latest) into your AP data directory. You should now have an ff4fe folder in there.\r\n5. Open your .apff4fe file with Archipelago. The SNIClient should detect it and begin patching. Once complete, it'll open the client window and attempt to launch the patched .sfc file.\r\n6. Connect your emulator to SNI through the connector.lua script located in SNI/lua.\r\n7. Connect your client to the server hosting your multiworld.\r\n8. Enjoy playing!",

      "description": "## Changes\r\n- The big one: MIABs have been changed. They're now randomized in Archipelago, allowing for a number of tweaks.\r\n- - There is no longer the separate client-given MIAB item. The MIAB chest and battle reward itself is the singular reward. Offworld items will still be represented by receiving a Cure1 potion.\r\n- - Randomization should follow all the same rules as vanilla FE: any MIAB in an area can end up in any of the chest locations in that area. Upper Bab-il before and after the Crystal fall trap are separate areas, and the two chests guarded by the D. Lunars boss location in the Subterrane are ineligible to be MIABs.\r\n- - If `EnableDefaultPriorityLocations` is on (the default, if you missed last update), these locations will be priority.\r\n- A new option has been added, `MIABRandomization`.\r\n- - This has three options. The default is the behavior described above. Setting it to `Vanilla` will keep MIAB fights in their vanilla locations, allowing you to plan around encountering them. The option `Vanilla Excluded` will additionally add these locations to the `exclude_locations` list, preventing them from having progression items. This allows you to skip them without fear of blocking someone in your multiworld.\r\n- A new option has been added, `JItems`.\r\n- - This has four options. `Allow` is the existing behavior: J Items will appear in shops and the itempool. `No Shops` and `No Itempool` function exactly as you'd expect, banning J Items from appearing in shops and the itempool respectively. Finally, `None` is a combination of the previous two options, removing J Items from both.\r\n- - None of these options affect enemy drops/steals.\r\n- New data has been added to the spoiler log.\r\n- - The APWorld version used for generation is now at the top of the spoiler log, before player specific settings.\r\n- - The locations of MIAB chests is now included, located before item locations. This was mostly for debugging, but I figure some of you might want that info present out of curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe setup guide can be found [here](https://github.com/Rosalie-A/Archipelago/wiki/Final-Fantasy-IV-Free-Enterprise-Setup-Guide)",
