They will apply at the start of the next Fragment, and last until either the Fragment is cleared or you die, whichever happens first\r\n  - **Disaster Traps** will activate the Level 1 effects (lava flowers & health loss when slow)\r\n  - **Landing Downgrade Traps** will downgrade any landing you make (Perfect -> Good, Good -> Ok, Ok -> Bad)\r\n- **Extra Shards** will add extra Progressive Shards to the pool to add a buffer to any Shard Goal setting\r\n  - **Remove Post-Victory Locations** has been changed to now *only* give you enough Progressive Shards to access you goal, instead of there always being 9 of them\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes\r\n- Added a comical amount of version checks to prevent future issues where old savedata caused new seeds to bug out\r\n- Added last-resort console commands to help unstuck bugged Shop/Fragmentsanity data\r\n  - The list of console commands can be found [here](https://github.com/WritingHusky/haste_apworld/blob/main/docs/ConsoleCommands.md)\r\n- Fixed issues where attempting to load a new save wouldn't kill any existing connections if they somehow weren't closed prior (Final Machine)\r\n- Fixed various issues regarding the unlock and logic conditions with the Flopsy and Weeboh costumes\r\n- Fixed issue where the default costumes would not be unlocked under certain circumstances\r\n- Fixed issue where the Shard 1 location group also included Shard 10\r\n- Fixed the vanilla bug where a shop with duplicate items will let you buy the rightmost item at the leftmost's price\r\n- Fixed visual issues with the Item notification and Captain purchases caused by the Haste 1.8.0 update\r\n- Fixed issue where Force Reloading from some NPC conversations softlocked the player\r\n- Fixed issue where starting_inventory could cause desyncs with the internal ExpectedIndex, resulting in duplicate items\r\n- Fixed issue where the Max Lives item wouldn't actually grant an extra life (because it's coded weirdly in vanilla)\r\n- Changed the default hostname to `archipelago.gg` instead of localhost",
