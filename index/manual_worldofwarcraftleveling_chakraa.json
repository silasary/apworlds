Since the items are not actually withheld from the player,\nthe player must manually refrain from using these gathered items until the tracker shows that they have been acquired or sent.",

      "description": "- NEW: Added a new option \"pre_or_post_cataclysm\" which will let you decide on what version of each zones are included in the pool. You might find this option interesting if you play old versions of the game with Vanilla, TBC or WOTLK.\r\n  - Added each old zones and their level ranges for those earlier versions.\r\n- CHANGED: Renamed the repo to \"World of Warcraft Leveling\" as you no longer specifically need the MoP version to run it\r\n- CHANGED: The \"easier_expansions_transition\" was revamped to \"easier_transitions\", which now affects logic to requiring 2 zones for each level bracket to be in logic instead of 1, to give the players more choices over where they can quest. On top of that, it will continue to require the first zone for each expansion to be in logic.\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/ChakraaThePanda/Archipelago-Manual-WorldofWarcraft-Leveling/compare/2025.11.01...2025.11.10",
