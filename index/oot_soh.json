      "description": "# Our first official release!\r\n\r\nWe're coming out of the gate strong with a ton of settings available. \r\n\r\nIf you're looking for instructions on how to use this, please check out our [GitHub page](https://github.com/HarbourMasters/Archipelago-SoH?tab=readme-ov-file#ship-of-harkinian--archipelago) for links to our setup guide and more.\r\n\r\nIf you run into issues and would like to report them, or want to see what is planned for the future, please take a look at our [issues page](https://github.com/HarbourMasters/Archipelago-SoH/issues).\r\n\r\n**NOTE: Archipelago 0.6.3 or higher is required to play this!**\r\n\r\n## A short overview of all features\r\n- Fully built into Ship of Harkinian, so take advantage of everything Ship has to offer\r\n- Many options out of the gate. Go from 360 checks by default to over 1600 when shuffling everything, with additional item shuffles and some QoL settings also available\r\n- Support for Windows, Linux, Mac and Steam Deck\r\n- Built in server console\r\n- Offline play (partially) supported\r\n- Co-op on a single slot supported\r\n\r\n## Full changelog\r\n\r\n### Client features\r\n- For now this is a separate version of Ship of Harkinian that AP support is built into. Later on this will exist within the main SoH releases. This means you can take advantage of all Ship features, like all enhancements, QoL, check tracker, item tracker, mods for textures/models/custom music, etc.\r\n- Support for Windows, Linux, Mac and Steam Deck\r\n- In the ESC menu inside Ship, there's a built-in server console, connection settings and an option to toggle Death Link\r\n- A fully integrated in-game selector when creating a save to load into an Archipelago save instead\r\n- Offline play support. You need to be connected to AP to create the savefile, but everything after can be played offline. Once you connect again, it'll automatically sync all of your progress.\r\n- Co-op on a single slot supported. Checks will be automatically synced between all players, and most checks will also appear as opened on the other player's game (like chests will be opened, etc). This also means you can make a new savefile on a different PC and continue playing there! Things like in-game flags aren't synced though, like dungeons completed, buttons pushed, etc.\r\n- Automatically connect when loading savefiles. Connection information is saved within your savefile, and it will automatically try to connect when loading into said savefile. You can even have multiple savefiles belonging to different multiworlds at once!\r\n- Custom models for archipelago items, for progression, filler and junk items. When picking up an archipelago item, it'll say what item it was and for what player. Shop items also show this before you buy these!\r\n- Every item that's for you acts entirely like it would in a regular randomizer, including showing the normal model and textbox. They're still synced to the server in the background though!\r\n\r\n### Area Access Settings\r\n- Closed Forest\r\n- Kakariko Gate\r\n- Door of Time\r\n- Zoras Fountain\r\n- Sleeping Waterfall\r\n- Jabu Jabu\r\n- Lock overworld doors\r\n\r\n### World Settings\r\n- Starting Age\r\n- Gerudo Fortress Carpenters\r\n- Rainbow Bridge, with available options: vanilla, always open, stones, medallions, dungeon rewards, dungeons completed, skull tokens or greg\r\n- Skip Ganon's Trials\r\n- Triforce Hunt\r\n\r\n### Shuffle Item Settings\r\n- Shuffle Skull Tokens (with an option to require Sun's Song for nighttime skulls to be in logic)\r\n- Shuffle Master Sword\r\n- Shuffle Child's Wallet\r\n- Shuffle Ocarina Buttons\r\n- Shuffle Swim\r\n- Shuffle Weird Egg\r\n- Shuffle Fishing Pole\r\n- Shuffle Deku Stick Bag\r\n- Shuffle Deku Nut Bag\r\n- Shuffle Freestanding Items\r\n\r\n### Shuffle NPC's & Merchants Settings\r\n- Shuffle Shops (from only shuffling vanilla item placements to randomizing 7 shop items per shop)\r\n- Set shop minimum and maximum price points\r\n- Shuffle Fish\r\n- Shuffle Scrubs\r\n- Set scrub minimum and maximum price points\r\n- Shuffle Beehives\r\n- Shuffle Cows\r\n- Shuffle Pots\r\n- Shuffle Crates\r\n- Shuffle Trees\r\n- Shuffle Merchants\r\n- Shuffle Frog Song Rupees\r\n- Shuffle Adult Trade Items\r\n- Shuffle Boss Souls\r\n- Shuffle Fairies (fountains, gossip stones, bean fairies and fairy song spots separately toggle-able)\r\n- Shuffle Grass\r\n\r\n### Shuffle Dungeon Items Settings\r\n- Shuffle Dungeon Rewards\r\n- Shuffle Maps & Compasses\r\n- Shuffle Ganon's Boss key, with available options: Vanilla, anywhere, LACS vanilla, LACS stones, LACS medallions, LACS dungeon rewards, LACS dungeons completed, LACS skull tokens\r\n- Key Rings\r\n\r\n### Timesaver Settings\r\n- Big Poe Target Count\r\n- Skip Child Zelda\r\n- Skip Epona Race\r\n- Complete Mask Quest\r\n- Skip Scarecrow Song\r\n\r\n### Additional Features\r\n- Full wallets\r\n- Bombchu Bag\r\n- Bombchu Drops\r\n- Blue Fire Arrows\r\n- Sunlight Arrows\r\n- Infinite Upgrades\r\n- Skeleton Key\r\n- Slingshot/Bow Break Beehives\r\n- Set ice trap amounts, both by setting an amount, or by setting what % of filler items should be replaced by ice traps\r\n\r\nAs a reminder, everything outside of the randomizer settings menu inside Ship of Harkinian is also available. All enhancements, all cheats, all mods, everything you'd be able to use in regular Ship gameplay is available here minus Ship's own randomizer features (those are dictated by Archipelago).",

We wanted to release this as 1.1.1 but sadly we made our client's version checking a little too na\u00efve.\r\n\r\nIf you're in the middle of preparing a multiworld using SoH 1.1.0 and want to update, please note the following:\r\n- Players will need to update their client to 1.2.0. In the future, we'll be able to release apworld-only releases (which will be versioned 0.0.x going forward).\r\n- Yamls from 1.1.0 are mostly compatible when using 1.2.0, but we removed a bunch of unused tricks from the APWorld, so those will have to be removed from the trick list if players have chosen them. Please check out the updated tricks list in the 1.2.0 default yaml, if the trick is no longer in there, it needs to be removed from your yaml.\r\n- If a host is already very far into organising a multiworld using 1.1.0, consider using our [apworld-only 1.1.0 Hotfix](https://github.com/HarbourMasters/Archipelago-SoH/releases/tag/SoH_1.1.0). Keep in mind when doing so, players need to use the 1.1.0 client as well.\r\n\r\nFor more information about updating, we've updated our [setup guide](https://github.com/HarbourMasters/Archipelago-SoH/blob/oot-soh/worlds/oot_soh/docs/guide_en.md) with a section on how and when to update your client and/or APWorld.\r\n\r\nWe're sorry for any inconveniences this has caused. Hopefully our improved version checking in the client will prevent this being necessary in the future.\r\n\r\n# Full changelog\r\n\r\n- Includes APWorld fixes from the 1.1.0 Hotfix, which fixes generation errors when other games were using entrance rando, and removes a faulty second Zelda's Lullaby from the item pool.\r\n- Removed all unused tricks as options.\r\n- Better version checking in the client.\r\n- Renamed Bombchu Bag item group to Progressive Bombchu Bag.\r\n- Fixed potential issue with the amount of skull tokens that were set to progressive.\r\n- Fixed one piece of heart missing from the item pool.\r\n- Fixed a minor issue in the Universal Tracker not getting proper information about keys.\r\n\r\n# Known Issues\r\n- save creation can fail if one of the players in the game uses any special characters in their name such as `\u00e9`. \r\nThis problem can be worked around by temporarily giving the offending name an alias during save creation using the /alias command.\r\n- UT isn't aware of shop items.\r\n- Zora Tunic is the wrong price in logic\r\n- Maps and Compass settings isn't set properly in the client",
