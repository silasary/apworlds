These now let you do things like !hint the earliest raw food or exclude_location all of a biome at once.\r\n  - Added Nightwatchers DLC content!\r\n    - Note: to add the new dlc, the old `enable_dlc` option has been split into `enable_keepers_dlc` and `enable_nightwatchers_dlc`.\r\n    - Standard species locations for Bats.\r\n    - Standard biome locations for Bamboo Flats and Rocky Ravine.\r\n  - Included manifest in apworld, meaning it should survive the impending breaking change with AP v.0.7.0.\r\n- Changed:\r\n  - Completely refactored the entire apworld and game mod. So added plenty of bugs!\r\n  - It should now be very unlikely for a blueprint to wind up with two recipes of the same resource with recipe shuffle.\r\n  - Updated the resource lock icon, to make it more distinct from the generic AP logo.\r\n  - Need icons should now also show lock icons when appropriate.\r\n- Fixed:\r\n  - Resolved issue that rendered Salt logically unusable.\r\n  - The giant node locations in marshlands should properly require their respective camps.\r\n  - The fully upgraded housing check for Frogs now properly checks for level 4 housing.\r\n  - Took another pass at fixing gifting. Please report any issues with interactions with other games.\r\n    - The in game notification should now say the resource name, not the name of the gift from its source game.",

When enabled, you will be unable to play in a biome until receiving its corresponding key.\r\n    - The UI should try to keep you from embarking locked biomes, however checks will be blocked inside locked biomes as well.\r\n  - Added per-profile connection memory! Now `ap.c` will keep track of your url:port + slot per ATS profile.\r\n    - `ap.connect` will be blocked when using a different slot/url, and prompt you to use `ap.connectForce` instead.\r\n    - This does unfortunately mean your existing `ap.c` memory will be ignored, as it's not currently associated with a profile.\r\n  - Added in game command to toggle deathlink state. Will reset to yaml setting whenever connecting to AP.\r\n  - Added an alert when checking a location. Control the feature with `ap.toggleLocationAlerts`.\r\n  - Added an alert when you get disconnected from the AP server.\r\n  - Added an alert indicating when connecting to AP is successful.\r\n- Changed:\r\n  - Internal: switched to using delegates for generically wrapping game actions that need to happen in a Unity thread.\r\n- Fixed:\r\n  - Perhaps resolved an issue with glade events not properly clearing/sending their locations?\r\n    - I didn't take any active steps to fix this, but I saw the issue before and no longer do now. I am guessing recompiling the mod on the latest game version might have fixed this.\r\n  - Deathlink related crashes should now be resolved, using the above mentioned delegate system.\r\n  - Removed some leftover `self.multiworld.random` references.\r\n  - Fishing huts now automatically disable primary recipes that are locked.",
