IT IS NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE WITH ANY PREVIOUS VERSION!\r\n\r\nPlease read everything below this to make sure you know what you sign up for.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: This release exists to share this very early version of a new method to generate the logic. To be able to use interesting new features like e.g. random spawn locations and random item locations it goes through an incredibly convoluted process. Due to this generating even a single Reventure seed takes a lot of time. During my tests it could take up to 10 minutes! This will be improved in the future (Hopefully otherwise this is pretty useless...).\r\nThis version might break during gen. It might break at the end of generation after 10 minutes. It might also contain broken logic and thus lead to worlds that are unbeatable. Please report any and all bugs you find in the discord! If at all possible include the multiworld if you got that far.\r\n\r\nSome of the endings are disabled in this version:\r\nBoth desert endings\r\nGreedy Bastard\r\nSustainable Development\r\n\r\nSome of the settings do nothing in this version:\r\nhardJumps is always enabled\r\nhardcombat is always enabled\r\ntreasuresword doesn't exist\r\n\r\nAlso I suggest setting endings not to high (e.g. below 40) and accesibility to minimal this should reduce generation failures.\r\n\r\nPlayer Facing there is one new feature: Random Spawn Locations. The start location is one of ca. 60 Locations. It could even be Lonks House!",

      "description": "## Better Nonstopmodes!\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: This Version is NOT compatible with previous APWorlds!\r\n\r\nThe game now supports different Nonstopmodes. Every \"higher\" option also includes all \"lower\" options:\r\n- Off: Turns off nonstopmode. All endings will restart your run. Just like in the vanilla game.\r\n- Canonical: This includes endings where I decided that it \"makes sense\" that you don't die. For example: Destroying all pots or stabbing people! This is purely based on the ingame action and not on the ending cutscene.\r\n- Logical: This includes all endings where turning them on does not break logic. For example: Jumping of cliffs or getting killed by the dragon. This does not include endings where you don't die but are softlocked (e.g. the infinite hole)\r\n- Everything: This includes... everything*. Some of these allow you to break logic, because you are invincible, can walk through spikes and lava or because hugging the boulder lets you skip past it.\r\n\r\nA few endings are not implemented because they are weird. I do want to implement them at some point though:\r\n- PickupAnvil\r\n- All Cannon Endings\r\n- Getting killed by minions\r\n- And of course my all time favourite: The whistle ending.\r\n\r\nFor a quick guide on which option to pick:\r\n- Pick \"off\" if you do not want to play with this feature. Particularly if you have not played the vanilla game!\r\n- Pick \"canonical\" if you care about the \"story\"\r\n- Pick \"logical\" if you want the most endings possible to be skipped without affecting logic (This is the \"suggested\" setting)\r\n- Pick \"everything\" if you are crazy\r\n\r\nSome of these lists are subjective. Feel free to make an argument for endings that should switch their category!\r\n\r\nAlso I do want to add the option for a custom list in the future! That way you can just add any ending you want.",
