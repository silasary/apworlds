Removed the flaky impassible terrain checks which caused more problems than were prevented. Anti-stuck checks now only run in Act hubs.\r\n* The Phoenix cut-scene softlock fix had some malformed ASM which resulted in an even worse problem. Should be fixed for real now.\r\n* Fixed issue where getting an NPC release from the Pass tile could get you trapped.\r\n\r\n**Attention: Please save your game early, and often. Having a save to fall back to can save you a lot of time if you happen to stumble onto another game-breaking bug.**\r\n\r\n(Thanks everyone who has tested the rando and reported their findings.)",
