First glide received will be glide, while consecutive glides become superglide.\r\n- Added a setting that allows the player to interact (open chests, examine, talk) in battle.

Now we have 10 postcards and 5 torn pages in the item pool.\r\n- Adjusted logic for worlds to require at least 2 worlds logically.
