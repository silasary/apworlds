Updating your YAML is recommended as well. This patch is for the most recent Pizza Tower version (v1.1.28) and will not work on any older versions, it's recommended to boot up the vanilla game first to make sure you're on the right patch.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- Added a new Lap 2 Portals item that will enable all lap 2 portals in your game when received, this can be toggled in the YAML.\r\n- Added a new Pumpkin Checks option, when toggled this will add all pumpkins as locations and allows the new Pumpkin item to be shuffled into the item pool. Pumpkins are needed to access Tricky Treat, the amount of pumpkins that are shuffled into the pool and the cost of Tricky Treat are configurable in the YAML.\r\n- Added options for trap and filler weights.\r\n- Implemented get_filler_item_name() function to better support item links.\r\n- S and P ranks now have dedicated rules instead of using the rules for a standard level clear.\r\n- Fake Santa Trap disappears on level restart or exit now.\r\n- Player aliases are now used for the in-game text pop-ups instead.\r\n\r\nBugfixes:\r\n- Fixed a major logic issue where only the last written rule would actually be applied.\r\n- Prevent any invalid packets from immediately crashing the game.\r\n- Fixed an items index desync that could occur when the server was shut down.\r\n- Trip to the Warzone chef task is not granted from a Timer Trap anymore.\r\n- Floor rank chef task logic works as intended now.\r\n- Numerous other logic fixes.",

Please check that both are up to date before you play! It's recommended that you update your YAML as well.\r\nWe've also whipped up a new custom text client to fix some persistent issues, so make sure to read the setup guide carefully; the process may be a bit different than you're used to.\r\n\r\nHere are the major changes:\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- Added optional transformation randomization: when toggled, this will randomize all transformations in the rando list as items hidden behind checks. You will be locked out of using these transformations until you find/receive them (feel free to hunt for all of the lock-out cutscenes!)\r\n- Added full Ring Link functionality: when toggled, several point sources (toppins, escape clocks, big toppins and pizzasonas) will add rings/points across all supported games with the feature enabled. These will be deducted while in Pizza Time or when damaged. 1 ring is equivalent to 10 points in Pizza Tower.\r\n- (Finally) added functional support for Unix-based platforms interfacing via Wine/Proton (Mac, Linux, Steam Deck)\r\n- Implemented an all-new text client for the game that acts as a proxy server which interfaces via a compressed websocket connection. Using this new client is now required to connect to Archipelago servers (which means you must install the game's apworld into your Archipelago Launcher)\r\n- Added a queue system for traps and Death Link, allowing for all received traps and Death Link events to properly activate as soon as possible\r\n- Allowed Death Link events to be executed in hub areas\r\n- Added support for location groups: when prompted to enter a location in your YAML file, you may enter the name of a level to indicate all locations within that level\r\n- Added a new login room background drawn by FuzzyEpic3\r\n\r\nBugfixes:\r\n- Fixed a crash that would sometimes occur in the main menu after disconnecting\r\n- Fixed a softlock that would occur in boss fights if the War Timer trap was received\r\n- Fixed a bug where the pumpkin count would break when the /collect command was used\r\n- Fixed a crash that would occur in the final judgement screen if your language file was invalid\r\n- Fixed a freeze that would occur if an in-game message contained an alias name with curly brackets\r\n- Various logic tweaks",
