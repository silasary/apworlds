      "description": "The first release of the alpha version of the Animal Well Archipelago integration.\r\nApworld by Scipio, RoobyRoo, and GameWyrm primarily.\r\nClient by Franklesby.\r\n\r\nYou probably need to use the 0.4.7 RC1. I have not tested it with 0.4.6. If it works with 0.4.6, please let us know and I can remove this note.\r\n\r\nWARNING:\r\nIt's early alpha. The game came out like 3 weeks ago. The client works most of the time.\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n- The contents of chests will appear vanilla in-game. See the client to see what was actually in the chest.\r\n- Filler items do not work. They are not implemented yet. You will need to use your imagination.\r\n- The client rarely fails for no real reason when opening a chest. We do not know why yet. If it fails, please let us know in the discord and send your log file as well (in the Archipelago logs folder).\r\n- Some yaml options are missing. This is intentional. They don't work yet.\r\n- There are softlocks in logic. If you get stuck, you can type `/ring` into the client to get the Cheater's Ring, which lets you noclip. Please do not rely on this, it will likely be removed when we find a better way to get you out of a softlock.\r\n- There is no poptracker. Use Universal Tracker instead, it will work.\r\n\r\nQuick update: Updated the released apworld for better logging.\r\nSecond quick update: Updated the released apworld to fix a failure when you get a bnuyy.\r\n\r\nInstructions:\r\nPut the .apworld in your Archipelago/lib/worlds folder.\r\n\r\nGenerate a template yaml by opening the Archipelago Launcher and click on Generate Template Options.\r\n\r\nCustomize your Animal Well yaml, put it in your Players folder.\r\n\r\nRun Generate from the Launcher. Host locally or upload it at the Archipelago uploads/host page.\r\n\r\nLaunch Animal Well. You must open the game before the client.\r\n\r\nOpen your load menu, and load into an empty save file. Do not load into a save file with progress on it.\r\n\r\nNow, open up the Animal Well client. It will search for the start address of your Animal Well game. This will take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes. Usually, it takes around 20 seconds. If it fails, restart both the game and the client.\r\n\r\nWhen it succeeds, you'll be able to connect to your Archipelago room. If it connects, you should be good to go.",
