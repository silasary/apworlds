The only check that for some reason doesn't appear on UT is Forest Temple Dungeon Reward, but that will happen automatically before the heart container chest anyway, which does show correctly\r\n- Tower of Spirits currently only includes the 1st section\r\n- please excuse the mixture of regional names for stations, I'll change that for next version\r\n- to board the train in aboda/outset you will need to complete both the bee boy and rock girl checks, then go in and out of a house. If something doesn't work right 1st try then you can always try going through a loading zone\r\n- I don't currently know how to change Link into his soldier outfit so you're stuck playing as Engineer Link for the forseeable :P",
