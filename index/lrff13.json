The AP seed does not need to be regenerated if coming from 0.1.0.\r\n\r\n# PSA\r\nIf you are upgrading Nova Chrysalia mod manager from 1.X to 2.X, extract the contents of the Nova 7z into your existing 1.X install. This will ensure files are properly tracked by 2.X. There is some risk if done incorrectly, so you may consider backing up your 1.X install first.\r\n\r\n# Known Issues/Limits\r\n- Nova Chrysalia mod manager must be closed for the LRRando program to generate a seed modpack\r\n- No option to disable DLC items in the pool yet (you must turn on DLC in the in-game settings)\r\n- Items sent to you are retrieved by holding the sprint button on the field (L2/R2 or LT/RT). This is a workaround to avoid crashes when trying to add automatically with no input.\r\n- Game overs are removed so you can technically get to the final day without completing the 5 main quests. This is safer for AP, but obviously that would be out of logic by skipping everything.\r\n- Chests that cost 6 EP are not currently in logic and are considered excluded/missable\r\n- Recovery items received from AP while your recovery item bag is full will be lost\r\n\r\n# Troubleshooting\r\n- Do NOT use the File > Reboot option in game, always close the game and relaunch through Nova\r\n- In Nova, always launch the game in Unpacked mode with \"Voice Over Setting\" set to the language you unpacked data for. \r\n\r\nIf you still have issues without not seeing modded content:\r\n1. Delete unpacked game data in Nova\r\n2. Unpack game data again in Nova\r\n3. Regenerate the rando modpack\r\n4. Uninstall and remove the old modpack in Nova, and re-install the modpack\r\n5.

      "description": "# Changelog\r\n## 0.3.1\r\n- Fix client updating inventory when your menu is open\r\n- Client now disconnects when the game is closed as automatically reconnecting was a bit buggy\r\n\r\n## 0.3.0\r\n- Fix performance issues on the field when looping through 9999 AP items to see if they were picked up\r\n- Fix ID 0 unknown location\r\n- Change yaml defaults for CoP and ultimate lair to false\r\n- Change EP cost randomization to slightly favor values closer to the original cost\r\n- Reduce bosses' HP placed in superboss locations by about 25%\r\n- Fix logic issues on Soul Seed quest and Seeing The Dawn\r\n\r\n0.3.1 only has client updates. Reinstalling the .aplrff13 is not required.\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\n- If you are upgrading Nova Chrysalia mod manager from 1.X to 2.X, uninstall all mods from Nova 1.X first, extract Nova 2.X to a new location, and install all your previous mods in Nova 2.X.\r\n- EN Text is required. Text for other languages is not supported due to maintainability concerns with the duplicated data.\r\n\r\n# Known Issues/Limits\r\n- Items sent to you are retrieved by holding the sprint button on the field (L2/R2 or LT/RT). This is a workaround to avoid crashes when trying to add automatically with no input.\r\n- Game overs are removed so you can technically get to the final day without completing the 5 main quests. This is safer for AP, but obviously that would be out of logic by skipping everything.\r\n- Chests that cost 6 EP are not currently in logic and are considered excluded/missable\r\n- Recovery items received from AP while your recovery item bag is full will be lost\r\n\r\n# Troubleshooting\r\n- Do NOT use the File > Reboot option in game, always close the game and relaunch through Nova\r\n- In Nova, always launch the game in Unpacked mode with \"Voice Over Setting\" set to the language you unpacked data for. \r\n\r\nIf you still have issues without not seeing modded content:\r\n1. Delete unpacked game data in Nova\r\n2. Unpack game data again in Nova\r\n3. Regenerate the rando modpack\r\n4. Uninstall and remove the old modpack in Nova, and re-install the modpack\r\n5. Be sure to launch the game in Unpacked and in the same voice language as unpacked data (EN/JP)!\r\n\r\n# Setup Guide:\r\n\r\nDownload the following:\r\n\r\n- lrff13.apworld\r\n- LRRandomizer#.#.#.#.7z\r\n- [Nova Chrysalia mod manager v2.0.3](https://mega.nz/file/24gyiB7b#nTIlktJb8ZCo8dXZDxCgwsdHAUDPURQhixSfucypIVg)\r\n\r\n### AP World and Seed Setup\r\n1.
