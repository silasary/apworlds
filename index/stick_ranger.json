Unlocks 1 class at the start and adds 7 class unlocks to the item pool. When enabled, Forget Tree is unlocked from the start.\r\n  - Forget Tree now has the option to select classes. This will keep all your progress but your classes can be chosen at will!\r\n  - Randomization used now uses the AP seed randomization.\r\n  - Improved generation chances of success with multiple Stick Ranger games (still not fully working)\r\n    - For a chance of a fail to happen you would need only Stick Ranger games with minimal locations in the generation which have different accessibility settings.\r\n\r\n### Client\r\n- Player colours in chat correspond to colours in a text client\r\n- Drop chances when enemy_shuffle is enabled are increased to 15% for common enemies and 50% for boss enemies (to be balanced later, e.g. the yellow fish enemies in Cavern 1/2/3)\r\n- Saving did not remember which enemies sent checks already, causing them the drop AP items again which did nothing, is now fixed\r\n- Most actions now add a console.log, for debugging purposes if anyone ever encounters issues\r\n- Sometimes, saving and loading would not remember stages beaten/booked correctly, now fixed\r\n- Full-screen now works on all devices!\r\n- Click and Touch functionality is now the same, meaning playing on Mobile is now working correctly!\r\n- Data is saved on Archipelago's DataStorage, meaning if ports change, your info is remembered. Also allows for cross-device playing!\r\n- Upon choosing \"New Game\", consistency in item-giving is now fixed\r\n- Class selection is now limited whenever class_shuffle is enabled\r\n  - You can change classes at the Forget Tree when you unlock more classes (also when shuffle_classes is not enabled)\r\n  - Forget Tree is unlocked at the start when class_shuffle is enabled\r\n- Overall improvements in stability of many functionalities \r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/Kryen112/AP_Stick_Ranger/compare/1.3.0...1.4.0",
