      "description": "First release. \r\n\r\nWhat should hopefully be possible:\r\n\r\n- Inclusion in multiworld generation by putting .apworld file in custom_worlds\r\n- Dicey Dungeons mod generation, will appear in the output as a zip file, which should be unzipped, then \"diceyap\" directory loaded into Dicey Dungeons /mods location\r\n- Launch of Dicey Dungeons client from the Archipelago Launcher. Boot game by running /dicey here after connecting.\r\n- Collection of items in game (mostly) and sending to server.\r\n- Sending game completion to server once all 6 Warrior episodes have been completed.\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n\r\n- File that is output for the mod is a .zip (probably frowned upon in AP) which must manually be installed by user. Future state will be something like a .apdicey file which can be patched in through the client\r\n- There are LOTS of debug messages still in the Client, that I am using for testing, and will eventually remove.\r\n- Episode 2 is hacked for boss / episode completion testing. Collecting all items here will not be possible\r\n- All starting equipment has been replaced with a testing equipment, which instantly kills everything. This will be removed, eventually.\r\n- Game must be in default Steam installation path, for now. Future state is the Client should handle setting this.\r\n- Most game options are non functional, or misleading. These will need cleaned up.\r\n- Icon for the Client in the launcher is broken, even though it worked when running from source. Sad.",

Install the .apworld file into your Archipelago's custom_worlds\r\n2. Set up your .yaml player options either through the Launcher's \"Options Creator\" or by modifying the attached .yaml\r\n3. Generate the game using the Launcher's \"Generate\"\r\n\r\nPlaying:\r\n1. Launch the \"Dicey Dungeons Client\" from the Archipelago Launcher\r\n2. Connect to your multiworld's host:port and your slot name\r\n3. Set your install path using `/install_location [your installation location]` (Not necessary if in default Steam install path)\r\n4. Run the command `/patch` to patch your game to handle the custom logic and items\r\n5. Launch Dicey Dungeons **from the client** with command `/dicey` (The mod can only see your location checks and set up your items correctly if you launch from the client)\r\n6. Enjoy\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- Due to technical issues I haven't figured out (yet), AP items from Dicey Dungeons send when you start any combat with them equipped. They will not send from your backpack, they have to be equipped. This is top on my list of things I would fix if I knew how",

Because of this, multiworlds generated using previous releases will probably not play well with the new client. I HIGHLY recommend waiting to upgrade to this release until all multiworlds generated have been played through.\r\n\r\nChanges from v0.1.2.1-beta:\r\n- Option: Episode progression - Choose between 'vanilla' (like starting a new save file, later episodes are locked until earlier episodes are completed) and 'open_world' (relies on your Dicey Dungeons save, all episodes available from start)\r\n- Option: Floor 5 Shop Selection - Choose between 'vanilla' (floor 5 shops will have an upgrade, a heal, and an item, which might be a multiworld item) and 'items_only' (floor 5 shops will have 3 items, all of which may be multiworld items)\r\n- Option: Skip Cutscenes - Choose whether you want intro/outro cutscenes for episodes to be skipped\r\n- Option: Split dice - Choose if you'd like dice (gained from leveling up) to be locked behind receiving a certain number of Dice Shards first. Configurable both in required numbers of dice shards per die, and number of spare dice shards added to the pool, for safety\r\n- Flavor: Revamped filler items - There are now multiple filler items, all inspired by fighters in game (e.g. Rotten Apple's Pet Worm)\r\n- Graphics: A new title screen, featuring an Archipelago logo created using the Characters from the game (inspired by krunk on Discord) will now appear instead of the default title screen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/Fylcoast/AP_diceydungeons/compare/v0.1.2.1-beta...v0.2.0-beta\r\n\r\n",
