      "description": "First release. \r\n\r\nWhat should hopefully be possible:\r\n\r\n- Inclusion in multiworld generation by putting .apworld file in custom_worlds\r\n- Dicey Dungeons mod generation, will appear in the output as a zip file, which should be unzipped, then \"diceyap\" directory loaded into Dicey Dungeons /mods location\r\n- Launch of Dicey Dungeons client from the Archipelago Launcher. Boot game by running /dicey here after connecting.\r\n- Collection of items in game (mostly) and sending to server.\r\n- Sending game completion to server once all 6 Warrior episodes have been completed.\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n\r\n- File that is output for the mod is a .zip (probably frowned upon in AP) which must manually be installed by user. Future state will be something like a .apdicey file which can be patched in through the client\r\n- There are LOTS of debug messages still in the Client, that I am using for testing, and will eventually remove.\r\n- Episode 2 is hacked for boss / episode completion testing. Collecting all items here will not be possible\r\n- All starting equipment has been replaced with a testing equipment, which instantly kills everything. This will be removed, eventually.\r\n- Game must be in default Steam installation path, for now. Future state is the Client should handle setting this.\r\n- Most game options are non functional, or misleading. These will need cleaned up.\r\n- Icon for the Client in the launcher is broken, even though it worked when running from source. Sad.",

      "description": "Beta release of the Dicey Dungeons Archipelago mod.\r\n\r\nDocumentation for playing can be found in the /docs directory for this world, but brief notes here.\r\n\r\nGeneration:\r\n1. Install the .apworld file into your Archipelago's custom_worlds\r\n2. Set up your .yaml player options either through the Launcher's \"Options Creator\" or by modifying the attached .yaml\r\n3. Generate the game using the Launcher's \"Generate\"\r\n\r\nPlaying:\r\n1. Launch the \"Dicey Dungeons Client\" from the Archipelago Launcher\r\n2. Connect to your multiworld's host:port and your slot name\r\n3. Set your install path using `/install_location [your installation location]` (Not necessary if in default Steam install path)\r\n4. Run the command `/patch` to patch your game to handle the custom logic and items\r\n5. Launch Dicey Dungeons **from the client** with command `/dicey` (The mod can only see your location checks and set up your items correctly if you launch from the client)\r\n6. Enjoy\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- Due to technical issues I haven't figured out (yet), AP items from Dicey Dungeons send when you start any combat with them equipped. They will not send from your backpack, they have to be equipped. This is top on my list of things I would fix if I knew how",
