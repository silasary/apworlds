(in other words, if your random start is telephone room or clockwork room for instance, your Boolossus event will move onto the balcony instead of still being in the east hallway, preventing you from opening that door).\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes!\r\n- GetItem command should work again for everything.\r\n- Fixed an issue where Boolossus was reappearing. Made similar changes to prevent Bogmire and Chauncey events from trying to trigger again.\r\n- All items found / received should be in-game now.\r\n- Toad Text boxes should provide a toad face instead of the weird options it was choosing before.\r\n- Twins Room chest is now fixed again and should provide the random item in the chest instead of mario's shoe.\r\n- An issue where the client was stuck \"infinitely\" has been fixed. Patching should be back to a few mins at most for slower computers.\r\n- Items that had shared names from other games (such as 10 coins) should no longer give items in LM.\r\n- The Red Diamond on the balcony plant was removed to prevent issues with our custom code from pickup animations being disabled.\r\n- Grimmly UT Logic fixes.\r\n\r\n## What Needs Tested:\r\n- Everything listed in New Stuff and Bug Fixes\r\n- UT Logic with these new fixes\r\n- Suggestions for furniture location names\r\n- Possession traps should always be received regardless of if the source is your game or not.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n- Linux build dependencies included in file, currently appear unworkable.\r\n- No MacOS support.\r\n- Client rarely unable to connect dolphin to check game ID.

      "description": "# Luigi's Mansion APWorld 0.4.4 Beta (the Bug Update)\r\nCurrently only available for Windows, apologies to other OS.\r\nTHIS WILL NOT BE BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE WITH OLDER AP WORLDS / PREVIOUSLY GENERATED SEEDS.\r\n\r\n# New Stuff (Small fix for Breaker Room + all changes from 0.4.3)\r\n- Elemental Medals and Mario items no longer have any pickup animations when pickup animations are turned off.\r\n- Added a bunch of logs to LM Client to help troubleshoot why clients are failing to patch and what step it is getting \"stuck\" at.\r\n- Changed more UT Stuff\r\n- Became compatible with 0.6.2 beta clients and can now use new clients for AP / UT.\r\n- Updated Boo Label to have a consistent size in the client.\r\n- In the Breaker Room, the doors are now locked for a brief period to allow that event to finish loading properly\r\n- Boo Radar logic now does not account for you catching any boos until you have at least one door unlocked (so you can leave and re-enter)\r\n- Added thorns on Clairvoya's door to prevent that event from having issues.\r\n- When capturing a boo, you no longer have to walk back to the original room, you will be able to get the reward immediately.\r\n- The Boolossus Balcony event will now appear on the balcony side if your spawn location is on the west side. (in other words, if your random start is telephone room or clockwork room for instance, your Boolossus event will move onto the balcony instead of still being in the east hallway, preventing you from opening that door).\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes!\r\n- GetItem command should work again for everything.\r\n- Fixed an issue where Boolossus was reappearing. Made similar changes to prevent Bogmire and Chauncey events from trying to trigger again.\r\n- All items found / received should be in-game now.\r\n- Toad Text boxes should provide a toad face instead of the weird options it was choosing before.\r\n- Twins Room chest is now fixed again and should provide the random item in the chest instead of mario's shoe.\r\n- An issue where the client was stuck \"infinitely\" has been fixed. Patching should be back to a few mins at most for slower computers.\r\n- Items that had shared names from other games (such as 10 coins) should no longer give items in LM.\r\n- The Red Diamond on the balcony plant was removed to prevent issues with our custom code from pickup animations being disabled.\r\n- Grimmly UT Logic fixes.\r\n\r\n## What Needs Tested:\r\n- Everything listed in New Stuff and Bug Fixes\r\n- UT Logic with these new fixes\r\n- Suggestions for furniture location names\r\n- Possession traps should always be received regardless of if the source is your game or not.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n- No MacOS / Linux support.\r\n- Client rarely unable to connect dolphin to check game ID. Reloading ISO should fix the issue\r\n- Items will de-spawn if you travel 2 rooms away. This is hard coded behavior that cannot be removed\r\n- If you receive traps during an animation, the trap will not trigger because you are in an animation, such as doors, warping or successfully vacuuming a Boo/Portrait Ghost\r\n- If you load in too quickly, sounds will be bugged for a little while\r\n- The 1F Bathroom corner runs into the boo gate event.

      "description": "# Luigis Mansion AP V0.5.0 (New Locations / Vacuum Update)\r\nWindows / Linux Compatible\r\n\r\n## New Stuff:\r\n- Add new ghost-hiding furniture locations (specifically those that hid ghosts or speedy spirits previously)\r\n- Add new starting and available base locations (Catch Training Room ghosts, Visiting E. Gadd in his lab, etc.).\r\n- No Vacuum Start - start without vacuum\r\n- Game Mode option - includes new Poltergust Hunt (Ice Rod hunt style)\r\n- New Door rando options - \u201cDoor rando but Suite doors locked\u201d, all doors unlocked, all doors locked\r\n- Add EnergyLink as an option - Make use of all that money that\u2019s just lying around! These commands: /send_energy, /receive_energy, and /display_energy are the commands for energy_link in the client\r\n- Add option to reduce or increase the difficulty of the Boolossus fight\r\n- Add Furniture items by floor as an option for Furnisanity\r\n- Add option to scream MARIO into the client every time Luigi calls out \"MARIO\" in-game\r\n- New client label containing Rank Requirement / Current Wallet value.\r\n- 4 new trap items, with associated Trap Link\r\n- Starting Rooms now have a toad, which that lets you warp back to the lab! Disabled if spawn already has a toad (such as the courtyard)\r\n- The Poltergust now comes in Progressive Vacuums! Maybe there\u2019s more than 2?\r\n\r\n## Changes:\r\n- Remove 1F Washroom boo gate completely, replace with key\r\n- Remove Laundry Room from potential spawn locations due to issues with new toad\r\n- Traps are now completely off by default\r\n- Reworked the client to avoid death loops. If you die and you haven't saved, the game remembers what the last received item was. Upon respawning, you receive only the items missed since you last saved, but traps will get skipped.\r\n- Changed the time of receiving items from ~3 seconds to less than 0.5 seconds. You do NOT have to wait in game for the receive text to actually have the item, in most cases you'll have the item before the text displays.\r\n- Added more traps to be supported in trap link.\r\n- Fixed an issue where Madam Clairvoya did not always appear when shining the light in her room.\r\n- Gallery Event no longer requires you to knock on an angel statue or scan it to leave.\r\n\r\n## Fixes:\r\n- Fix Freestanding keys not having ghost logic rules\r\n- Fix Well key not spawning or triggering\r\n- Fix Sir Weston not sending checks when on\r\n- Fix trap_link always being on\r\n- Fix bug with auto_connect not working correctly\r\n- Fix Item_links locations appearing in hints, I hope\r\n- Fixes some slot name issues not properly supporting 16 UTF-8 characters.\r\n- Removed Mr. Bones text in the Boneyard.\r\n- Updated our third party dependencies to use a temp folder again.

If she does not spawn from shining a light on her crystal ball, inform us in the discord channel to help us indentify the issue, but saving quitting and reloading should fix the issue.\r\n- Small text changes / color changes in the Gallery / Lab in game events.\r\n\r\n## Fixes:\r\n- Generation bugs that were related to vacuum_start but you excluded any vacuum upgrades.\r\n- An issue where a \"negative\" amount of vacuums were detected.\r\n- Traps should be working again\r\n- Trap Link -> If you send a trap to others, you should also now receive it in game.\r\n- Boo Counter display is fixed again for when Boosanity is selected.\r\n- Fixed a misspelling with \"Suite\" instead of \"Suit\"\r\n- Updated Boo Radar option description.\r\n- Starting room toad will no longer kill you when you choose heal.\r\n- Starting room toad location will now send properly.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues:\r\n- If you run on source and NOT on windows, there is an issue where line endings of certain files that remove CRLF and convert it to LF, causing the game to fail to load in multiple places, specifically around text in game.
