      "description": "Here is the first playable release of Cavern of Dreams on Archipelago!\r\nSome things to note:\r\nSome options exist that aren't currently implemented, like custom starting areas and entrance rando. I recommend leaving them as default.\r\nGeneration is a slog. I've disabled simplification of the generated logic (it's a buggy work in progress), so it is highly redundant. Expect things to be faster in the future.\r\nDifficulty is mostly defined by how much effort it took for me to complete it - with the amount of time I've spent on the logic, I may have underestimated some tricks. Note that if you enable a tech, you're expected to already have a good deal of confidence in performing it - difficulty comes into play only when it's noticeably more difficult than usual to traverse. Please let me know if you have any routing questions, or would like to suggest that something have its difficulty increased.",
