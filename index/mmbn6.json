The location check will still be sent, but if it's a local item, it will need to be received via a `/send` command. Try to avoid skipping these cutscenes until after you see the `get item` textbox.\r\n- Green Town's Quiz King is still locked by Seaside Town's Quiz Master. There is logic to require Fish before Quiz King is in logic, but worth noting.\r\n- Certain checks that could theoretically scout their contents (such as WWW ID and BtlrCard navis) are not currently scoutable locations. As such, before buying the items, they will display the wrong item.\r\n- Fighting Bass always gives the BatKey, even if it is located elsewhere. You can still get the randomized item from this location (don't skip the cutscene for local items), but you will get BatKey as well.\r\n- The puddle to Seaside Area from Central 3 is not a 2-way obstacle. As such, you can go from Seaside into Central 3 even without `ToolPrgm`, but you can't go from Central 3 to Seaside without it.\r\n- `AreaPass` does give access to ACDC Area, but it was not designed to be used when coming from the rest of Central 3. You need to trigger the dialogue, then exit and re-enter the area to remove the invisible obstacle.\r\n- Requests can only be selected one at a time. This can lead to softlocks if you're not careful. Please be cautious about only accepting requests you know you have access to, or save before grabbing a request.

This allows us to set the set the Cybeast icon to true so we can eventually enable Cybeast SP or ProtoMan as options, and speeds up the client marking a game as completed.\r\n- Adjusted the name of Undernet Zero Heel Navi to match format of other Undernet Zero locations.\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n- Adjusts the client so that nothing (including checking for victory status) is done unless the game state is 0x04. Should fix a rare issue where the game releases unintentionally.\r\n- Fixes an issue with using /send or !getitem when the item doesn't have a BN6 location assigned. \r\n- Corrected the colors for Charge+1 and Speed+1, which were flipped.\r\n- Corrected the program item IDs for several programs, ensuring they are sent with the correct color.\r\n- Fixed Seaside Pavilion Waterfall displaying the extra RegUp textbox.\r\n- Added explore score indirect conditions to Undernet and Graveyard region entrances to fix an issue when running Archipelago unit tests.\r\n\r\n## Status\r\n- Only works for Gregar for now (Falzar soon TM)\r\n\r\n### Checks\r\n- Base pool: 289\r\n- Settings:\r\n  - Request Rewards: 38\r\n  - EX Bosses: 6\r\n  - SP Bosses: 6\r\n  - Graveyard checks: 7\r\n- Total with all exclusions: 232\r\n- Locations per region (all options enabled):\r\n  - Central Town: 103\r\n  - Central Internet: 9\r\n  - Central 3/Underground: 10\r\n  - Seaside Town: 33\r\n  - Seaside Internet: 17\r\n  - Green Town: 20\r\n  - Green Internet: 17\r\n  - Sky Town: 30\r\n  - Sky Internet: 15\r\n  - ACDC Town: 3\r\n  - ACDC Internet: 6\r\n  - Undernet: 7\r\n  - Graveyard: 7\r\n  - Expo Site: 12\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n- Skipping a cutscene that can give an item (such as after Link Navi classes or after Bass) can result in not receiving a local item.

Now, `.apbn6g` and `.apbn6f` files will be supported, which will work for Gregar and Falzar respectively.\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n- Added a game version option to support choosing either Gregar or Falzar.\r\n- Added a new location check for defeating Bass SP. This check can be excluded via the `include_graveyard` option.\r\n  - Along with this, Bass F and BassAnly F chips have been added to the item pool.\r\n- Added Virus Battler location checks, which require the BtlrCard key item to become available. These can be excluded with a new `include_virus_battler` option.\r\n  - Along with this, BtlrCard has been added as a progression item in the pool.\r\n\r\n### Logic Fixes\r\n- Fixed a logic issue with Get the Bad Guy request requiring KeyData instead of Central 3 access.\r\n- Fixed a logic issue with Undernet Zero BMD 3 not requiring Link Navi that can clear tornados.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Added `archipelago.json` manifest file to support an eventual Archipelago update.\r\n- All quizzes will now be enabled at the start of the game, and not need to be done in order.\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n- Fixed a bug with receiving RegUps due to the game re-calculating RegMem upon getting an item.\r\n- Adjusted initial patch to set the received index address we are using to 0 upon starting a New Game. This allows players to receive all of their items properly if they want to hit New Game instead of Continue for any reason.\r\n\r\n## Status\r\n- Requires ROM for generation.\r\n- Upcoming Features:\r\n  - APProcedurePatch support for ROM-less generation.\r\n  - Virus randomization.\r\n  - New checks like Bass BX, ProtoMan, ProtoMan FZ, and other link navi fights.\r\n  - Optional goals, like Bass, Bass SP, Bass BX, Beast SP, or ProtoMan FZ.\r\n\r\n### Checks\r\n- Base pool: 295\r\n- Settings:\r\n  - Request Rewards: 38\r\n  - EX Bosses: 6\r\n  - SP Bosses: 6\r\n  - Graveyard checks: 8\r\n  - Virus Battler checks: 5\r\n- Total with all exclusions: 232\r\n- Locations per region (all options enabled):\r\n  - Central Town: 104\r\n  - Central Internet: 10\r\n  - Central 3/Underground: 10\r\n  - Seaside Town: 34\r\n  - Seaside Internet: 17\r\n  - Green Town: 21\r\n  - Green Internet: 17\r\n  - Sky Town: 31\r\n  - Sky Internet: 15\r\n  - ACDC Town: 3\r\n  - ACDC Internet: 6\r\n  - Undernet: 7\r\n  - Graveyard: 8\r\n  - Expo Site: 12\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n- The client is required for certain location checks (specifically EX and SP bosses) to give items, and is required to set flags when receiving Crosses, BeastOut, and BtlrCard items. As such, playing offline will not fully work, so players cannot play on console for single player games yet, and you must be connected to the client to fully experience the game.\r\n- Skipping a cutscene that can give an item (such as after Link Navi classes or after Bass/Bass SP) can result in not receiving a local item. The location check will still be sent, but if it's a local item, it will need to be received via a `/send` command.
