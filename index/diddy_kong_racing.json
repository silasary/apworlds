To get around this, you can go back into the race, pause, and return to lobby.\r\n- Collected keys reappear when reloading a race.\r\n\r\nSpecial Thanks:\r\n- [jjjj12212](https://github.com/jjjj12212) and everyone who has contributed to the [Banjo-Tooie Archipelago integration](https://github.com/jjjj12212/Archipelago-BanjoTooie). This project is based off of their work. Not only was having their example to work off of hugely helpful, I had never even heard of RAM hacking before playing Banjo-Tooie in Archipelago, so I would never been able to do this without them.\r\n- [David Benepe](https://github.com/DavidSM64) and everyone who has contributed to the in-progress [Diddy Kong Racing decompilation](https://github.com/DavidSM64/Diddy-Kong-Racing). Referencing that helped a lot with RAM searching.",
