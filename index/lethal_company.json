My plan for the next major update is to focus on adding some useful terminal commands. I don't think I'll move the connect command to the terminal because of the limited space and character set, but if enough people want me to I'll work on it.\r\n\r\nGithub release: https://github.com/Awesomeness278/APLC/releases/latest\r\nThunderstore mod: https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/APLC/APLC/",

Expect bugs since this is a new major update, and **updating your mod from pre 0.6.0 to post 0.6.0 _might_ work but I'd caution against it**.\r\napworld updates:\r\n - Added two new settings: min_monster_chance and min_scrap_chance. Bestiary entries and scrapsanity checks will now only be in logic if their spawn chance on any reachable moons is greater than this probability. If a scrap or monster is never accessible, it is guaranteed to have a filler item or trap.\r\n - Increased maximum collectathon scrap goal to 99\r\n - Added the ability to add custom content to the randomizer(check the github readme for more info)\r\n - starting_moon is now a string input, and all custom moons will work too. Entering abbreviations like exp, off, mar, or art now also works.\r\n - modify_scrap_spawns is now randomly shuffled based on your seed\r\n - added new v50 content\r\n - exclude_shotgun now also excludes the Knife\r\n \r\n mod updates:\r\n  - fixed bug with the mod not realizing it was connected when it autoconnected you\r\n  - the mod now disconnects from the multiworld after leaving a save file\r\n  - updated tracker command to use the new settings\r\n  - added GetGameLogicString() function for adding custom content(check the github readme for more info)\r\n  - fixed some scattered bugs\r\n  - added new v50 content\r\n  - make sure you are on the same LC version and have the same custom content mods as the apworld you generated from, otherwise there might be some weird behavior\r\n \r\nGithub release: https://github.com/T0r1nn/APLC/releases/0.6.0-beta\r\nThunderstore release: https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/APLC/APLC/",

This is only phase 1.\r\n* scrap inside the company cruiser now gets checked off properly\r\n* added a few unit tests for easier development\r\n* added a license for the Archipelago library to the Thunderstore package\r\n* added comments to document the function of classes and some methods for future contributors\r\n* Moved most config options to a config file so they will carry across saves, and added some new config options. Some of these will sync with the host config.\r\n* the moon page in the terminal always shows all moons, but indicates which ones are locked\r\n* added compatability with DawnLib and set up for it to potentially replace LLL\r\n* WE now have a license, too!\r\n* Failing quota now instantly starts you on your starting moon rather than routing to experimentation first\r\n* 'Filler triggers instantly' config option is now off by default\r\n* Players are now notified of unspent filler items when landing at the company building\r\n\r\nApworld:\r\n* fixed an issue with monsters that have 0 weight on all moons \r\n* added a manifest\r\n\r\nMod version 0.7.9 WILL work with apworld versions 0.7.7 AND 0.7.9",
