With this setting, almost all AP artifacts give two AP items instead of one, to compensate for the amount of artifacts to artifact offerings ratio.

It shows you which items you can access, which ones you've gotten, and which ones have been hinted.\r\n- Added the `auto_release_characters` option (off by default). With it, you can set an amount of run completions required for a character to automatically release all their associated items, so that you never need to run with them again. Be careful though, some of these items may be traps!\r\n- The mod now checks more accurately for the APworld version when connecting, and should give a more precise error in the log in case of version mismatches in the future.\r\n- Hovering over character portraits anywhere will now show you the amount of memories (or memory items in case of `shuffle_memories`) that you've found with them in the tooltip, including during a run.\r\n\r\nThe YAML and APWorld must both be updated.\r\n\r\nAs always, thanks everyone for the feedback!
