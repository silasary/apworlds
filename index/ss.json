(v0.5.2)\r\n- Several fixes for generation errors ( by Harmjan387 - see [#24](https://github.com/Battlecats59/SSArchipelago/pull/24), [#25](https://github.com/Battlecats59/SSArchipelago/pull/25), and [#26](https://github.com/Battlecats59/SSArchipelago/pull/26) )\r\n- Completion condition fix ( by LelouBil - see [#22](https://github.com/Battlecats59/SSArchipelago/pull/22) )\r\n- Shuffled Batreaux Counts ( by Battlecats59 - see [#19](https://github.com/Battlecats59/SSArchipelago/pull/19) )\r\n  - Options including vanilla (5-80), half (2-40), random (1-80), random-high (30-80), and random-low (1-50)\r\n    - Batreaux check names are changed to contain the required amount of crystals. Kukiel will also appear in Batreaux's house, telling you what the shuffled crystal counts are.\r\n  - Batreaux progression option is now a range 0-7, which will determine how many of Batreaux's rewards can possibly contain progression items.\r\n    - If set to 0, no Batreaux rewards can contain progression items.\r\n    - If set to 7, all Batreaux rewards could contain progression items.\r\n    - If set to any number (n) between 0 and 7, then the first (n) rewards could contain progression items, and the highest rewards will not contain progression items.\r\n- Print client messages in-game ( by YourAverageLink - see [#21](https://github.com/Battlecats59/SSArchipelago/pull/21) )\r\n  - A cosmetic option has been added to the patcher to allow client messages in-game to be turned on or off before iso generation.\r\n  - If turned on, client messages will be printed in-game in the bottom left corner of the screen.\r\n- Fix for incorrect hints ( by Harmjan387 - see [issue #22](https://github.com/Battlecats59/SS_APWorld/issues/22) and [PR #28](https://github.com/Battlecats59/SSArchipelago/pull/28) )\r\n- Separate option for Lanayru Caves Small Key - moved away from dungeon small keys\r\n  - New option has choices \"Start With\", \"Caves\", \"Lanayru\", and \"Anywhere\". All options will ensure that you will not be locked out of sand sea / lanayru desert / and so on, no matter where your starting statue or entrance is.\r\n- APWorld is now auto-generated by a github workflow, like the patcher build is.\r\n- Added an icon to the Skyward Sword client on the Archipelago launcher\r\n- Fix for APPlayerContainer issue in AP 0.6.2\r\n- Update to AP 0.6.2\r\n\r\n## What has changed? (v0.5.1)\r\n- Fixes for issues during seed generation: #20 \r\n- Logic fixes\r\n- Update to AP 0.6.1\r\n\r\n## What has changed? (v0.5.0)\r\n- Logic has been rewritten to support entrance randomization. There will likely be logic bugs floating around, some may not have a significant impact while some may end your run. Hence, **use at your own risk!**\r\n- Random starting statues and random starting entrance options are now fully supported.\r\n- The itempool generation has been changed significantly, fixing several bugs regarding starting items and item placements. Although it is unlikely, there may be bugs that were created as a result.\r\n- Single crystals have been added as AP-recognized checks, however they will remain as single gratitude crystals for the time being.

Kukiel will also appear in Batreaux's house, telling you what the shuffled crystal counts are.\r\n  - Batreaux progression option is now a range 0-7, which will determine how many of Batreaux's rewards can possibly contain progression items.\r\n    - If set to 0, no Batreaux rewards can contain progression items.\r\n    - If set to 7, all Batreaux rewards could contain progression items.\r\n    - If set to any number (n) between 0 and 7, then the first (n) rewards could contain progression items, and the highest rewards will not contain progression items.\r\n- Print client messages in-game ( by YourAverageLink - see [#21](https://github.com/Battlecats59/SSArchipelago/pull/21) )\r\n  - A cosmetic option has been added to the patcher to allow client messages in-game to be turned on or off before iso generation.\r\n  - If turned on, client messages will be printed in-game in the bottom left corner of the screen.\r\n- Added an icon to the Skyward Sword client on the Archipelago launcher\r\n- Fix for APPlayerContainer issue in AP 0.6.2\r\n- Update to AP 0.6.2\r\n\r\n## What has changed? (v0.5.1)\r\n- Fixes for issues during seed generation: #20 \r\n- Logic fixes\r\n- Update to AP 0.6.1\r\n\r\n## What has changed? (v0.5.0)\r\n- Logic has been rewritten to support entrance randomization. There will likely be logic bugs floating around, some may not have a significant impact while some may end your run. Hence, **use at your own risk!**\r\n- Random starting statues and random starting entrance options are now fully supported.\r\n- The itempool generation has been changed significantly, fixing several bugs regarding starting items and item placements. Although it is unlikely, there may be bugs that were created as a result.\r\n- Single crystals have been added as AP-recognized checks, however they will remain as single gratitude crystals for the time being.

Kukiel will also appear in Batreaux's house, telling you what the shuffled crystal counts are.\r\n  - Batreaux progression option is now a range 0-7, which will determine how many of Batreaux's rewards can possibly contain progression items.\r\n    - If set to 0, no Batreaux rewards can contain progression items.\r\n    - If set to 7, all Batreaux rewards could contain progression items.\r\n    - If set to any number (n) between 0 and 7, then the first (n) rewards could contain progression items, and the highest rewards will not contain progression items.\r\n- Print client messages in-game ( by YourAverageLink - see [#21](https://github.com/Battlecats59/SSArchipelago/pull/21) )\r\n  - A cosmetic option has been added to the patcher to allow client messages in-game to be turned on or off before iso generation.\r\n  - If turned on, client messages will be printed in-game in the bottom left corner of the screen.\r\n- Fix for incorrect hints ( by Harmjan387 - see [issue #22](https://github.com/Battlecats59/SS_APWorld/issues/22) and [PR #28](https://github.com/Battlecats59/SSArchipelago/pull/28) )\r\n- Separate option for Lanayru Caves Small Key - moved away from dungeon small keys\r\n  - New option has choices \"Start With\", \"Caves\", \"Lanayru\", and \"Anywhere\". All options will ensure that you will not be locked out of sand sea / lanayru desert / and so on, no matter where your starting statue or entrance is.\r\n- APWorld is now auto-generated by a github workflow, like the patcher build is.\r\n- Added an icon to the Skyward Sword client on the Archipelago launcher\r\n- Fix for APPlayerContainer issue in AP 0.6.2\r\n- Update to AP 0.6.2\r\n\r\n## What has changed? (v0.5.1)\r\n- Fixes for issues during seed generation: #20 \r\n- Logic fixes\r\n- Update to AP 0.6.1\r\n\r\n## What has changed? (v0.5.0)\r\n- Logic has been rewritten to support entrance randomization. There will likely be logic bugs floating around, some may not have a significant impact while some may end your run. Hence, **use at your own risk!**\r\n- Random starting statues and random starting entrance options are now fully supported.\r\n- The itempool generation has been changed significantly, fixing several bugs regarding starting items and item placements. Although it is unlikely, there may be bugs that were created as a result.\r\n- Single crystals have been added as AP-recognized checks, however they will remain as single gratitude crystals for the time being. In the future, these checks may be randomized, for now they have been added to support single crystal logic.\r\n- Code has been cleaned up.\r\n\r\ngl, hf! -bcats\r\n\r\n### Downloads:\r\n\r\n[RECOMMENDED] The zip file containing the apworld, YAML, and setup guides (ss_apworld-v0.5.5.zip)\r\n[RECOMMENDED] The patcher build (SS_APPatcher-v0.5.5.zip)\r\n\r\nThe apworld file (ss.apworld)\r\nThe template YAML file (Skyward.Sword.yaml)\r\n*The above two files are contained in the first zip, and do not need to be downloaded if you download the apworld zip*",
