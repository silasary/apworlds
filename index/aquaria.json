  "description": "Aquaria is a side-scrolling action-adventure game. It follows Naija, an\naquatic humanoid woman, as she explores the underwater world of Aquaria.\nAlong her journey, she learns about the history of the world she inhabits\nas well as her own past. The gameplay focuses on a combination of swimming,\nsinging, and combat, through which Naija can interact with the world. Her\nsongs can move items, affect plants and animals, and change her physical\nappearance into other forms that have different abilities, like firing\nprojectiles at hostile creatures, or passing through barriers inaccessible\nto her in her natural form.\nFrom: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaria_(video_game)",

If that happen, some item still in logic could become unobtainable.\r\n    * Note that this make it possible to go in the body bottom area (gauntlet) without freeing Li from it's cage. Li is still needed to battle the Creator though.\r\n- Adding websocket compression\r\n- Adding some Glitch options:\r\n   * Some Sing bulbs can be checked by singing from far away (across wall or steam)\r\n   * Fish form may be used to go around blocking rocks\r\n   * In Sun Temple, the save crystal can be use to teleport from the left side to the right side of the temple\r\n   * The Dark Jelly in Mithalas City can be used to cross the top path stream\r\n   * Fish Form can be used to cross steam and get the Trident Head\r\n   * Nature Form Jump can be used to climb Sun Temple boss path cliffs\r\n   * Can use Rock jump and Bind Song to get to the Urchin Costume",
