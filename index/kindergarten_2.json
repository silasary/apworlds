It should automatically connect, or fail to do so and tell you in the console\r\n- Your Archipelago save will take up all 3 save slots, and your original saves will be unaffacted, but **inaccessible as long as you remain modded** (This is why making a copy of the original, to have a vanilla game available, was recommended).\r\n\r\nYou can play multiple games at once with only one installation, as the Archipelago save files will remain, yet be hidden, when connecting to a different multiworld.\r\n\r\nThe exception is an exact copy of the same multiworld (same multiword seed, and same slot seed), as they will conflict their save files.\r\nEven then, the game state is almost entirely decided dynamically, from the server, so a conflicting save file should not cause problems",
