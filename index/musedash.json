If you run into issues please downgrade to v0.7.0 or v0.6.6\r\n- Newtonsoft.Json.dll is now included. This may resolve some rare issues.\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n### Melonloader\r\n*Melonloader is required to play with this mod.  However reinstalling it is not required on update.*\r\n\r\n1. Download MelonLoader.Installer.exe from https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases/latest and run it.\r\n2. Choose the automated tab, click the select button and browse to `MuseDash.exe`.\r\n    - You can find the folder in steam by finding the game in your library, right clicking it and choosing *Manage\u2192Browse Local Files*.\r\n    - If you click the bar at the top telling you your current folder, this will give you a path you can copy. If you paste that into the window popped up by **MelonLoader**, it will automatically go to the same folder.\r\n3. The launcher will automatically default to the latest version. \r\n    - If the latest version is not working: **Untick Latest and select 0.6.6.**\r\n4. Click install. Once finished run the game once.\r\n\r\n### Mod Install\r\n\r\n1.Download `ArchipelagoMuseDash.zip`.\r\n2. Head to the Muse Dash folder and open up `/mods/`.\r\n3. Extract the contents of the .zip file into mods.\r\n   - Ensure that `ArchipelagoMuseDash.dll` and `Archipelago.MultiClient.Net.dll` are under `/mods/` and not within a sub folder.\r\n4.
