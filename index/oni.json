There has been a lot of bugfixes and stability improvements.\r\n\r\nLatest version now should support all possible mods, most recently support was added for mods that add new Techs (aka Research items) like [Rocketry Expanded](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2837919908) or [Ronivan's Legacy](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3557584850&searchtext=ronivan)\r\n\r\nI've added a new way of checking if the connection is active. If this says you're disconnected;\r\n<img width=\"261\" height=\"100\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a88eb637-1a7d-4afd-aac2-70ef84b2896d\" />\r\nA notification will appear on the left.\r\n<img width=\"469\" height=\"69\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7657cdd-c302-4e0a-abcc-194b9fdb9357\" />\r\n\r\nNew options are added to the config along with this. Auto reconnect is on by default (as it always was). Now that there is a way to reconnect manually in game, this can be turned off if you want.\r\n<img width=\"296\" height=\"56\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2e5c882-1a90-4fce-addc-8e7866c40ccc\" />\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you start on a Frosty DLC or Prehistoric DLC Planet, the Research Portals are now functional, as in they give you free research as they do in vanilla. 2 buildings for Frosty and 3 for Prehistoric.\r\n<img width=\"810\" height=\"62\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e3e64c0-6b9a-4adf-b5a1-3f34e5782ad6\" />\r\n",

If you have previously installed this apworld, you **MUST** uninstall the old one to avoid conflicts.\r\nTo do this, navigate to your `Archipelago` installation, find the `lib/worlds` folder and delete the folder called `oni`\r\nFrom now on, the .apworld file needs to be placed in `Archipelago/custom_worlds`\r\n\r\nTons of new features and bug fixes have been added. Notable differences are new options in the YAML for additional location checks which can be enabled or disabled. Newly discovered resources on your starter planet, and optionally the teleporter connected planet are now location checks. Care packages have been added to fill in items for these new locations. \r\n\r\nFull Support for Bionic DLC has been added including additional logic that is applied.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Make the world apworld compatible by @silasary in https://github.com/ShadowKitty42/ONI-Archipelago/pull/1\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @silasary made their first contribution in https://github.com/ShadowKitty42/ONI-Archipelago/pull/1\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/ShadowKitty42/ONI-Archipelago/compare/v0.85...v0.9",
