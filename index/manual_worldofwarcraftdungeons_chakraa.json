Since the items are not actually withheld from the player,\nthe player must manually refrain from using these gathered items until the tracker shows that they have been acquired or sent.",

      "description": "This AP was left to die (kind of) as it hasn't been updated since The War Within released and changes to the game were made\r\n\r\nSo, I took the time to fully revamp the core of this AP, while keeping the aspect it was meant to do in the first place.\r\n\r\n- Added: You can now play this AP as a non-free to play user, meaning you can queue for all Pre-TWW dungeons (at this time) if you set your YAML option to \"All\".\r\n  - The \"Free to Play\" mode, which allows access to all dungeons at level 20 or under, is still available, making it easier to make a character and hop in the AP as soon as possible.\r\n- Added: You can now select which expansion to randomly select dungeons from as a YAML option.\r\n- Added: You can now select how many dungeons you have total in the pool as a YAML option.\r\n- Added: You can now select how many items each completed dungeons will send as a YAML option.\r\n- Added: You can now select how many Gold Coins (your goal) there are to find in the pool as a YAML option.\r\n- Changed: You will start with an amount of Gold Coins equal to 100 minus the amount you wish to find, so the goal is always to find \"100 Gold Coins\". This helps the AP work a bit better in terms of logic.\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/ChakraaThePanda/Archipelago-Manual-WorldofWarcraft-Dungeons/compare/1.0...2.0",
