Since the items are not actually withheld from the player,\nthe player must manually refrain from using these gathered items until the tracker shows that they have been acquired or sent.",

Since the merchant is the first interaction upon starting a new round, you may buy whichever weapon you start with. Fresh save runs still only start with the Handgun.\r\n\r\n- Reclassified some weapon's category to prevent them from being in the random starting pool.\r\n\r\n- - This includes the Special Rocket Launcher from the final Saddler fight.\r\n- - All grenades are now classified as Single Use Weapon\r\n- - Weapon stocks and scopes are now classified as Weapon Enhancement\r\n- Fixed an issue with Memo not showing up in the location list when connected.",
