      "description": "No actual items to find, but will contain priority checks for all other locations. Requires being in a seed with at least 1 non-`password` world that implements `get_filler_item_name`.\r\n\r\nTo play, you need the browser extension (load it in development mode). Supports Firefox, Edge, and Chrome (until Manifest 2 support is removed). Then go to https://neal.fun/password-game/ and connect to the archipelago session. To disable AP mode, disable or remove the extension.\r\n\r\nTo generate, download the .apworld and place in your local Archipelago install's `lib/worlds` folder. You can use the Archipelago Launcher to generate the template yaml.\r\n\r\n**People will hate you and you may hate yourself if you run this in a multiworld.**\r\n\r\nEDIT: 2023-07-07 6:00 PM CDT\r\nI did a bad in my .apworld so I uploaded a fixed version. If you have some games crash when connecting, this should fix it for games generated now.",
