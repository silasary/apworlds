This actually adds an interesting dimension to Picross, you'll see!\r\n- You don't have to guess in this puzzle, so please don't :)\r\n- You can solve all puzzles by just looking at each row and column individually.\r\n- 1000+ puzzles are randomly generated\r\n- Please click the `help` button in-game for controls.\r\n\r\n(game files are here if you're interested https://github.com/spinerak/NonogramAP)",
