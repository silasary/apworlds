I pretty much only worked on the serverside and that was mainly bugfixes (of which there are still many to come, im sure). \r\n\r\nThe main reason for this release other than to just get the current stuff tested out is that there may be a new balatro update in the next coming days, so getting this out is not a bad idea for now, so we have time to update our mod (hopefully not much necessary here).\r\n\r\nUpdate: so it turns out the content update will be in 2025, so still a few months to go luckily!\r\n\r\nAdditions:\r\n* new goal \"beat unique decks\" where each win for a deck on a different stake counts towards the goal separately. Thank you to @SpaD-Overolls for implementing the clientside.\r\n* pretty much every AP Bonus item or trap you receive now has its own custom icon, drawn and implemented by @SpaD-Overolls \r\n* Archipelago shop items are now shuffled (@SpaD-Overolls)\r\n* Added a lot of description text for items (thank you to @SpaD-Overolls)\r\n* Added russian localization (by @SpaD-Overolls)\r\n* Added german localization\r\n* Challenges are no longer playable in the Archipelago profile (added a \"coming soon\" label) (@SpaD-Overolls)\r\n* Items from other mods don't appear anymore if you're connected to Archipelago \r\n* The UI of the mod \"Galdur\" is now also compatible with this mod\r\n\r\nFixes:\r\n* Fixed some debuffed Jokers to work even though they shouldn't (thank you @SpaD-Overolls)\r\n* The apworld generation has greatly improved its world generation and has better balancing now\r\n* Seed Money and Money Tree now interact with bonus interest correctly  \r\n* Fixed the legendary joker and the sould notifications (@SpaD-Overolls)\r\n* Fixed a crash when deathlink is enabled\r\n\r\nBehind the scenes:\r\n* Code is now split into multiple files to not lose your mind when trying to find a function\r\n* Localization is now properly implemented in this mod which makes it easier to change the UI text\r\n* apworld code has also undergone great refactoring and is now actually presentable and i don't lose my mind (as much)  there anymore\r\n* There is now a short video tutorial explaining how to install lovely, steamodded and this mod! surely i wont have to remake it once the balatro update is out\r\n\r\nUpcoming features:\r\n* Challenges \r\n* new UI to display goals\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\n* When disconnecting from the server the game crashes.

This is why I recommend downloading the latest branch [here](https://github.com/SpaD-Overolls/BalatroAP) instead of the balatroAP.zip in this release\r\n\r\nAs with the latest few releases, a huge thank you goes out to @SpaD-Overolls, they took over all of the client side development again. \r\n\r\nAdditions:\r\n* Consumable AP Items: new Planet/Tarot/Spectral Card that unlocks an item when redeemed (@SpaD-Overolls)\r\n* New main menu UI to display goals/connection status (@SpaD-Overolls)\r\n* Config menu: You can set certain settings like death link or choose if jokers should be debuffed or removed. Default behaviour is to follow the yaml settings. You can also customize the main menu UI a bit. (@SpaD-Overolls)\r\n* Locked AP Items now display their name in the collection (previously just \"Locked AP Item\" -> now \"Locked AP Item (Red Deck)\") (@SpaD-Overolls)\r\n* Hints are now shown on Locked Items if available (@SpaD-Overolls)\r\n* Looking at Shop AP Items will now permanently add them as hints (@SpaD-Overolls)\r\n* Full french translation added (@deoxis9001)\r\n* Mod now checks for minimum Steamodded version (@SpaD-Overolls)\r\n* You can now enable jokers from other mods when connecting to Archipelago (@SpaD-Overolls)\r\n* You can now set the size of Joker bundles (2-30 jokers per bundle)\r\n* You can now make custom consumable bundles (up to 5 bundles, more info in the yaml. This feature is considered \"beta\". It may break.)\r\n\r\nFixes:\r\n* Fixed stake progress resetting on reload\r\n* Permanent bonus hands/discards now properly update if player is on a run while received\r\n* Some AP world generation issues\r\n* Improved yaml settings descriptions\r\n\r\nUpcoming features:\r\n* Challenges\r\n* Saving progress serverside\r\n* Better handling if server disconnects during runs\r\n* Multiple AP saves at once",
