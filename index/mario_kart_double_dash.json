      "description": "# First public release of Mario Kart Double Dash Archipelago!\r\n\r\nAt this point basic functionality is included, although the process is a bit dry bones... I mean bare bones. Here's short overview of included features.\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\n\r\nYour goal is to obtain Gold Trophies by winning cups. Getting enough trophies opens All Cup Tour, and winning it is your end goal. There's also a setting for having the end goal be just the trophies.\r\n\r\n## Items\r\n\r\nFollowing things are unlockable:\r\n* Characters (you begin with 2 random characters)\r\n* Karts (you begin with one kart per weight class)\r\n* Upgrades for karts (various stats)\r\n* Vehicle classes and cups for grand prix\r\n* Courses available in time trials\r\n* Item box items, some per character, some are unlocked for everybody\r\n* Starting items for time trials\r\n* Cup skips (lets you start in second or third course of a cup)\r\n\r\n## Locations\r\n\r\nFollowing things give you items:\r\n* Getting bronze, silver and gold cups and finishing a cup for the first time\r\n  * These are per cup and per vehicle class\r\n  * Winning at higher level nets you the low-level cups as well\r\n* Winning, being at first place after the first lap or finishing a course for the first time\r\n  * Finishing a course can be done in either time trial or grand prix\r\n* Getting good time and beating staff ghost times in time trials\r\n* Winning with a character using their default kart\r\n* Winning with a character in their own course\r\n* Getting gold with a light, medium and heavy carts, as well as Parade Kart\r\n\r\n## Quality of Life / Fun Things\r\n\r\n* Courses can be shuffled.\r\n* You can set courses to be 2 laps long, or custom amounts for each course.\r\n* Mirror mode can be 200cc.\r\n* All Cup Tour length can be changed, if you don't want to go through all 16 courses to finish the game.\r\n* Logic difficulty setting - you are guaranteed some upgrades before winning races is expected.\r\n* Universal Tracker support.\r\n  * Option for UT to show all technically available locations, even if logic difficulty was set to easy.\r\n* `/unlocked` command to show all currently unlocked thingies\r\n  * Hopefully these will be displayed in-game some day...\r\n\r\nAll in all, I find the game already quite enjoyable, and I hope you could test it too! There's still room for improvement, so if you run into any problems, consult the troubleshooting section of the [setup guide](https://github.com/aXu-AP/archipelago-double-dash/blob/987fa5be2b721edc9434b27fd2f48c33d3934424/worlds/mario_kart_double_dash/docs/setup_en.md).",
