They can either kill all active Pikmin, kill a captain, or randomly select one of these two.\r\n- Add boss randomization\r\n  - Includes options to shuffle all bosses and randomize them completely\r\n  - Titan Dweevil is excluded from this pool\r\n- Add onion shuffle\r\n  - The water around the Blue Onion is removed\r\n  - The electric gate blocking access to the Blue Onion is changed to a normal gate if it is blocking the Yellow Onion\r\n- Quality of life changes\r\n  - Yellow/Blue Onion discovery cutscenes no longer play\r\n  - Captain reunite cutscene no longer plays\r\n  - Captains are now considered reunited after the first switch to Louie, so he can access Olimar's Pikmin before the bag is crushed on Day 1\r\n- Fixed a bug where the Off-World Item still had the Doomsday Apparatus' collision :)\r\n\r\n## Known Bugs\r\n- Game will occasionally crash when loading the next day after the debt is repaid\r\n- Game will occasionally crash upon picking up certain treasures.

The pikmin2\\_game_\\<seed>.txt file is no longer used; instead, the client reads the received items directly from the save file.\r\n  - This means that, if you close the game/crash before receiving an item properly, the item will be resent next time you open the game.\r\n- Fix a bug where Pokos were obtained even though no items were received, by slightly changing the way items are received. This should hopefully fix the bug, but it is hard to reproduce so I'm not entirely sure it did.\r\n- Change the classification of most items:\r\n  - The Spherical Atlas and Geographic Projection are progression + useful\r\n  - The rest of the Explorer Kit treasures are progression\r\n  - The non-Explorer Kit treasures are progression + deprioritized\r\n- Clogs are removed from caves that normally appear in Wistful Wild\r\n- Change the Doomsday Apparatus to weigh 200 instead of 1000\r\n  - This may have been done in the previous version and I forgot to put it in the changelog...oops\r\n\r\n## Known Bugs\r\n- Game will occasionally crash when loading the next day after the debt is repaid\r\n- Game will occasionally crash upon picking up certain treasures.

      "description": "**NOTE: This mod is still in the testing phase. Play at your own risk.**\r\n**NOTE 2: Games generated on earlier versions will NOT work on this version.**\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n- Add support for WebWorld hosting (thank you Red for suggesting + helping with this)\r\n- Add new option: Treasure Checks\r\n  - Adds checks at certain user-defined treasure intervals\r\n- Add new option: Poko Checks\r\n  - Adds checks at 10%, 20%, 30%, etc. of the debt\r\n- Add Spicy and Bitter Sprays to the pool as filler items\r\n  - They show up in-game as normal AP items\r\n- Add better error messages for the client during linking\r\n- Fix a bug where the patcher would close if it encountered an error without letting the user see what the error was\r\n- Fix a bug where Volatile Dweevils were able to hold treasure but not drop them\r\n\r\n## Known Bugs\r\n- Game will occasionally crash when loading the next day after the debt is repaid\r\n- Game will occasionally crash upon picking up certain treasures. This commonly happens with the first treasure you pick up on Day 2, usually whatever is in the Utter Scrap location. Entering a cave before collecting it usually avoids the crash.\r\n- Queen Candypop Buds sometimes show up as white instead of red, even if you have Red Pikmin unlocked. This means that you can't use them to generate Red Pikmin, but you can use them to generate White Pikmin.\r\n- Whatever cave is in Submerged Castle's location will always have the vanilla Submerged Castle music\r\n- Sometimes starting items will not be received properly, if this happens usually restarting the game and client causes them to appear\r\n- Sometimes the Pikmin can't break gates in caves. Usually resetting the cave fixes this.",
