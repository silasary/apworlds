However, it should always be used instead of the initial 0.1.1 release. Don't forget to rename it back to `sonic_rush.apworld`, or else it won't be loaded by the AP software.\r\n\r\n## APWorld\r\n### QoL\r\n- Added item groups: `Zone Unlocks (Sonic/Blaze)`, `Emeralds`, `Chaos/Sol Emeralds`\r\n### Docs\r\n- Added Docs\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n- (Hopefully) Fixed item receiving issues\r\n- Fixed a typo in checking the zone 4 boss with Blaze (Discord@thegreenviper8)\r\n- Fixed zone access logic\r\n- Fixed boss S rank locations not getting checked if the option was set to `only_bosses` (0.1.1-debug only)\r\n### Technicalities\r\n- Changed save data setup complete flag to 0x6b\r\n- Reworked client sending received items to the game\r\n- Replaced every `add_rule` with `set_rule`\r\n- Tweaked item filling to reduce generation failures\r\n- Removed path generating in spoiler\r\n\r\n## Rom\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n- Sol emeralds appearing sometimes as fully collected (Discord@thegreenviper8)\r\n- Freezes after defeating some main game bosses (Discord@gurglemurgle)\r\n- Extra Zone freezing after a few seconds (Discord@kangdide)\r\n- Freezes after defeating F-Zone (and apparently Extra Zone too) (Discord@thegreenviper8)\r\n- Zone accessibility changing after defeating any boss\r\n### Technicalities\r\n- visual emeralds now set by calculating function instead of manually when loading overworld\r\n- Removed overlay0001 extension and moved custom functions to arm9\r\n- Included checking for F-Zone and Extra Zone in zone transitioning function (+ corrected using actual zone index instead of location index)\r\n- Capping of first 0xFF part of save data disabled\r\n\r\n## Is this version compatible with older multiworld slots and save files?\r\n- ~~Yes, but you must clear your save data using the in-game options\r\n  **No items will be lost, as the client resyncs them**~~ No due to changing the save data initialization flag",
