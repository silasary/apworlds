      "description": "# Changes from the base game\r\n\r\n## Misc\r\n* Entering Corneria will set your team's shields to max. This is to prevent a softlock that can occur if Falco is down, but you need to take the Mission Accomplished route.\r\n* If Slippy goes down in Sector X, he will be revived for the next level. This is to prevent Slippy from being bugged until you complete Titania\r\n\r\n## Map\r\n\r\nTo help Star Fox 64 fit into the environment of Archipelago, the map has been changed significantly. When completing a level, you are no longer forced to the next level based on what you did in the previous level. You can also no longer use the `Change Course` or `Retry Course` options on the map. Instead, the map has controls for selecting which level you can go to. The levels available for selection depend on what path items you have received. The map also functions as a sort of in game tracker.\r\n\r\n**Controls**\r\n\r\n* `D-Pad Right` brings you closer to Venom\r\n* `D-Pad Left` brings you closer to Corneria.\r\n* `D-Pad Up` and `D-Pad Down` change the path from the previous level.\r\n\r\nFor example, let's assume you have Corneria selected, and have all paths. `D-Pad Right` will select Meteo. From here, `D-Pad Up` will select Sector Y. `D-Pad Left` will select Corneria again.\r\n\r\n**Map Legend**\r\n\r\n* A colored path means that you have that path as an item. You will be able to take that path when selecting a level.\r\n* An animating Arwing means that you have access to the level, but haven't yet completed the level in a way that would normally take that path.\r\n* A stationary Arwing means that you have completed the level in a way that would normally take that path.\r\n\r\n## Locations\r\n\r\n* Getting Mission Complete, Mission Accomplished or a level warp.\r\n* Getting a Medal.\r\n\r\n## Items\r\n\r\n* Paths between levels. You need these to in order to traverse the map.\r\n* Medals. You can require a certain number of Medals before Venom is accessible.",

      "description": "# Changes since v0.1.0\r\n\r\n* New YAML option `accomplished_sends_complete`:\r\n  * Options are `true` or `false`\r\n  * When set to `true`, getting `Mission Accomplished` on any level will also count as getting `Mission Complete` for that level.\r\n* New `Star Fox 64 Client` command `/autostart`:\r\n  * This command will let you select a program to automatically run every time the client opens.\r\n  * The selected command is saved to your `host.yaml`. Default arguments for this program are also saved there.\r\n  * The program will be launched with any saved arguments (defaults to using the lua) and the path to the patched ROM.\r\n  * For example with default settings: If you use `/autostart` and select EmuHawk.exe, the `Star Fox 64 Client` will open Bizhawk with the patched ROM and lua connector automatically loaded.\r\n  * Using `/autostart` again will disable this behavior.\r\n* The number of `Medals` you have received, along with the number required to enter Venom is now displayed on the map.\r\n* Gray paths on the map are no longer transparent. This makes them much easier to see with certain settings (mainly on console).\r\n* The `Star Fox 64 Client` will now remember the path to the vanilla ROM (saved in `host.yaml`), allowing it to automatically patch when needed.\r\n* Updated the `setup guide` to give more instructions.\r\n* The `setup guide` and `game info` documents will now show on the WebHost.py.\r\n* The Bizhawk connector will now print a helpful message if loaded outside of the Archipelago/data/lua folder.\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n* When already patched, the path to the patched ROM will now show after the automatic `/help` output, instead of before.\r\n* Fix `await` error in `Star Fox 64 Client` every time a location is sent.\r\n* Increase ping timeout threshold and don't increase ping time during laggy frames.\r\n  * This will help stop the `Unexpected packet: 1` errors.\r\n* The map should more reliably update when receiving new items.\r\n* Fix communication error with EverDrive64 connector.\r\n* Fix `D-Pad Up` and `D-Pad Down` sometimes not working when returning from a level.\r\n\r\n## Misc\r\n* Other minor fixes and changes for development.",
