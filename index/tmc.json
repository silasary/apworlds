It's only intended for early testing trackers with a debug client\r\n\r\nThis should be tested with [BadMagic's Debug Client](https://github.com/BadMagic100/ArchipelagoDebugClient) to help checking locations. While you can playthrough the game to check locations, some locations don't get filled and many items won't be sent to you. If you're going to playthrough it anyway use the DebugMode for Bizhawk to be able to give yourself many of the unhandled progression items.\r\n\r\n- Added all known locations to be randomized. This list should mimic v0.6.2a of the MinishRandomizer.\r\n- Logic is practically excluded! There's only a few rules in place while item handling is being worked on. \r\n- Options are included but are currently ignored. They only get filled into slot data for loading into a tracker. Regardless of options set the game will act as if the following options are set:\r\n  - Keysanity\r\n  - Shuffle elements into item pool\r\n  - Disable glitches\r\n  - Obscure spots\r\n  - Add available rupees to pool (Rupeesanity)\r\n  - Open fusion mode\r\n  - Ped Open/Regular DHC\r\n  - No Sword Ped\r\n  - 4 Element Ped\r\n",

Don't exclude more than 2 dungeons when using this setting. `shuffle_elements: vanilla` will still ignore `excluded_locations`\r\n- Items and Deathlinks should now only be received when the player is \"safe\"; outside of cutscenes, dialogs, and other actions that lock the player.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\nSeveral well known options are forced on/off while they are still in development. They are:\r\n- Open Fusions\r\n- No Sword Ped / 4 Element Ped\r\n- Traps: disabled\r\n\r\n#### Checks\r\n\r\n- Base Pool: 342\r\n- Settings\r\n  - Rupees: 98\r\n  - Obscure: 54\r\n- Location Groups (all randomization enabled):\r\n  - Shop: 6\r\n  - Graveyard: 5\r\n  - DWS: 17\r\n  - CoF: 21\r\n  - FoW: 31\r\n  - ToD: 42\r\n  - PoW: 24\r\n  - RC: 5\r\n  - DHC: 9\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\n\r\n- Walking through a transition the exact frame you get an item that displays the pickup animation may delete the item. `!getitem` will be required if this happens.\r\n- There's a logic error with the DWS Madderpillar Heart Piece location. You may be expected to access it without Gust Jar.\r\n- Scrubs do not give you dungeon items or kinstones. If you get one of these items from them it won't be added to your inventory. Use `!getitem` for now.",

The game now won't process received items until your in a room that's \"updating\". This will probably prevent items from being received in Ocarina Glitch state.\r\n- Change received_index address due to overlap with Times Quickwarped. Quickwarping should no longer stop you from receiving items\r\n- Change back to using the bomb item to unlock them rather than bags. \r\n  - Pending: Possibly changing bombs to be progressive\r\n- Change from using empty bottles to specific bottles. \r\n  - UNTESTED! Subject to Change!\r\n- Add refill items like hearts, bombs and arrows to the pool. Will probably adjust their weights later, I just decided them on a whim.\r\n- Fixed several locations not sending.\r\n- Hiding goal options for now.\r\n- Adding deathlink option (still doesn't do anything yet)\r\n- Add different item sprites for different item classifications.\r\n  - Red clock = filler\r\n  - Blue clock = useful/normal\r\n  - Green clock = progression\r\n  - Traps will be a random color\r\n- Added South Field logic and fixed a couple others\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/eternalcode0/Archipelago/compare/v0.0.2...v0.0.3",

Not really an issue but it'll probably get reported as one. Maybe I'll change them, dunno yet.\r\n- Bottles are given but use the wrong id, the tracker won't see them as a result. NOT a bug with the tracker!\r\n- Stockwell's shop items don't *look* randomized but they are. Buying them gives the correct item though\r\n- Deathlink enabled without `death_link_gameover` has a chance to accidentally send a death during room transitions",

See the generated yaml for the list of options possible.\r\n  - `weapon_bomb`: Adds Bombs to the list of possible weapons. Enabling this may expect you to fight some/most enemies with only Bombs\r\n  - `weapon_bow`: Adds Bow to the list of possible weapons. Enabling this may expect you to fight some/most enemies with only the Bow\r\n  - `weapon_gust`: Adds the Gust Jar to the list of possible weapons. Enabling this may expect you to fight enemies affected by the Gust Jar alone\r\n  - `weapon_lantern`: Adds the Lantern to the list of possible weapons. Enabling this may expect you to fight Wizzrobes with only the lantern\r\n- Added Item Group:\r\n  - `Bottle`: Includes all empty bottles and all bottles with randomized contents\r\n- Added Dungeon Clear Events\r\n  - The spoiler log will now show when a dungeon becomes clearable. Ex. `Clear DWS` will show in the sphere tracker when the Green ChuChu can be defeated.\r\n  - Dungeon Clears will be excluded if the entire dungeon is excluded with something like `excluded_locations: [\"DWS\"]`. \r\n  - `ped_dungeons` will also not expect you to clear dungeons that have been excluded. \r\n\r\n#### Changes\r\n\r\n- `early_weapon` now randomly picks a weapon to place. Only sword is possible to place by default, each enabled entry of `weapon_bomb`, `weapon_bow`, etc, will add that item to the possible items to place early.\r\n- Dungeon item `own_dungeon` settings now correctly exclude placing items from `start_inventory_from_pool`.\r\n- Dungeon items can now be placed on in their boss rooms.\r\n- Renamed a small handful of locations and items\r\n\r\n#### Fixes\r\n\r\n- (Finally?) Fixed items possibly disappearing when given during a transition\r\n- Fixed DWS Madderpillar Heart Piece possibly not requiring Gust Jar\r\n- Fixed Scrubs not giving dungeon items & kinstones correctly\r\n- Fixed non-check scrubs not selling the correct item\r\n- Fix Droplets Right Path Underpass items being collected in the wrong order\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- Fusions are locked to \"Open\" while we prepare the logic for it.\r\n- Pedestal Figurines setting is still being worked on.\r\n\r\n#### Checks\r\n\r\n- Base Pool: 342\r\n- Settings\r\n  - Rupees: 98\r\n  - Obscure: 54\r\n- Location Groups (all randomization enabled):\r\n  - Shop: 6\r\n  - Graveyard: 5\r\n  - DWS: 17\r\n  - CoF: 21\r\n  - FoW: 31\r\n  - ToD: 42\r\n  - PoW: 24\r\n  - RC: 5\r\n  - DHC: 9\r\n\r\n### Major Known Issues\r\n\r\n- The game will crash upon trying to purchase any bottle item from Stockwell\r\n",

No interaction is required in game to receive this item.\r\n    - none: Disables the location\r\n    - dhc_big_key: Specifically rewards the Big Key (DHC) without requiring item plando\r\n    - random_item: Rewards any item as if it's a regular randomizable location\r\n  - Toggle `ocarina_on_select`: To bind the Select button to your Ocarina without equipping it to your action buttons\r\n  - Toggle `boots_on_l`: To bind the L button to your Pegasus Boots without equipping it to your action buttons. This was already the default but now you can disable it.\r\n  - Toggle `boots_as_minish`: To allow boots dashing while still Minish size.\r\n  - Toggle `big_octo_manipulation`: To automatically skip the Big Octorok's ink/charge phase.\r\n  - Toggle `replica_tod_boss_door`: Adds a copy of the Boss Door to the ToD Main Hall to prevent softlocks when entering before opening the door from the entrance.

It won't be added to the item pool or options but can still be obtained through `start_inventory` option or the `!getitem` command. It is classified as progression but should be considered \"no logic\" since it could grant access to almost every check in the game. Once obtained it will show up in your inventory to the left of your sword slot.\r\n\r\n#### Changes\r\n\r\n- In case a restrictive item/location pool is used in a solo slot world - too many items were added without enough locations shuffled - a new option error message will be thrown during generation to explain what settings to change to improve generation odds. This was common when using settings like `non_element_dungeons: excluded` along with a high `figurine_amount` and most location shuffle options turned off.\r\n\r\n#### Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fix the black screen from loading a save file made after sleep warping without exiting Smith's House. #46 \r\n",
