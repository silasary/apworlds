Logic was not aware of this, and now it is.\r\n\t- Fixed \"ED (Passages): Hack 2 Statues\" so it logically requires Unbounded Counter for the hammer statue.\r\n- Changed the Jiequan 1 fight in Factory (Great Hall) so that you can simply walk past Jiequan if you don't want to be forced into the Prison sequence yet. Now you have to stand in front of him and press a button to trigger those events.\r\n- Added a \"Show Archipelago Messages In-Game\" client setting that defaults to true, so now you can disable this in the usual F1 menu if you want the game to stop logging AP messages.\r\n- Loading an \"Adventure Completed\" randomizer save after defeating Eigong will now take you back to your last root node save before entering New Kunlun Control Hub (instead of starting a brand new save file). This should make it much easier to continue checking locations after the goal is complete.\r\n- Deleting a save file should now correctly (if vanilla) re-enable the button once it says New Game, and (if AP) hide the Change Connection Information button.\r\n- Cixing's spawn conditions (and the conditions for the 3 sage statues lighting up) have been fixed to depend only on examining the murals in the 3 tombs. For some reason in vanilla they also sometimes maybe depend on having the database entries for the murals, so receiving those AP items was putting them in confusing states.\r\n- Corrected the \"Furnance\" typo in \"Factory (GH): Examine Furnace Monitor\" location name",

Note this is a yaml/generation option because it (slightly) affects logic.\r\n- Reimplemented Jiequan 1 camera lock disabling. Hopefully the camera will no longer get confused if you happen to be in Factory (GH) when you unlock Jiequan 1.\r\n- Attempted to mitigate native Unity crashes on receiving items. I'm not expecting much since these kinds of crashes are out of any mod's control, but it's worth a shot.\r\n- \"Factory (U): Below Walkway to Left Exit\" was in the wrong logic region, making it incorrectly logically reachable without air dash to cross the laser blocking the left side of Factory (U).\r\n- In some cases, checking \"FSP: Isolate the Mutant Gene Sequence\" would incorrectly give you the vanilla reward (Super Mutant Buster) in addition to the Archipelago item. Hopefully we got the last of these cases.\r\n- Added a Client/Mod Settings section to the README\r\n- Prevent the base game code from showing the Lady E map marker at incorrect-for-rando times, and from showing a Ruyi map marker for a conversation you may have already perma-missed.",

Thanks @GameWyrm and @Chris-Is-Awesome for the \"websocket thread\" theory.\r\n\t- There may or may not be other sources of native crashes we haven't pinned down yet.

Apparently my test builds and my release builds have been configured to use completely different versions of the Archipelago client library this whole time, and it never caused any problems until AP 0.6.2's release.\r\n- Universal Tracker features:\r\n\t- Yaml-less support. Exactly what it sounds like: You don't need to keep the .yaml around any more to use UT with Nine Sols.\r\n\t- Map Pages. This is effectively a poptracker pack inside of Universal Tracker. Just launch UT as usual, connect to a Nine Sols slot, and you'll see a \"map page\" tab appear. It will wake up on a world map, but as you move around the game it will load different map pages for each area you enter.\r\n- Logic fixes:\r\n\t- \"AF (Depths): Hack 3 Statues\" now logically requires Tai-Chi Kick\r\n\t- \"ED (Passages): Hack 2 Statues\" no longer logically requires Air Dash, since I realized it's really easy with just Cloud Leap\r\n\t- The goal / Eigong fight is now logically placed in Central Hall instead of Four Seasons Pavilion. This doesn't matter yet, but it likely would become a problem once alternate spawns are implemented.\r\n- The white/non-Archipelago on-screen message when checking a location has been removed, since we're pretty sure location checking works and this is just redundant. So now you'll only get the standard Archipelago message.\r\n- Fix `shuffle_sol_seals: false` to generate the same number of items as locations. I don't know of any player workflows this was breaking in practice, but it was a clear bug and an easy fix.\r\n- Fix \"Memoral\" typo in \"Central Hall: Examine Launch Memorial\" location name.",

It's difficult to prove this works, but anecdotal experience with the Outer Wilds randomizer implies it's the only effective way for mods like this to mitigate native Unity instability.\r\n- Applied the new `deprioritized` flag to the least helpful progression items so they'll be ignored by `priority_locations` (if you're generating with AP 0.6.3 or later), in addition to the `skip_balancing` flag I was already applying. Those items are: (Artifact) Ancient Sheet Music, (Artifact) Legend of the Porky Heroes, Homing Darts, Thunderburst Bomb, Ancient Penglai Ballad, Ji's Hair, and Tianhuo Serum.\r\n- Fixed all known bugs with the Universal Tracker Map Pages:\r\n\t- Added missing \"AF (Elevator): Elevator Shaft\" location\r\n\t- Added missing \"AF (Elevator): Over Electrified Floor\" location\r\n\t- Added missing \"Central Hall: Examine Launch Memorial\" location\r\n\t- Corrected position of \"ED (Sanctum): Defeat Mutated Xipu Below Nobility Hall\" location\r\n- Updated the Universal Tracker section of the README, including screenshots of the Map Pages\r\n- Edited `skip_soulscape_platforming` description to explain its effect on logic\r\n- Tweaked my project configuration and dev/release build processes to reduce manual steps involved in updating the Archipelago MultiClient.Net client library. This *should* prevent any repeats of the issue which broke Nine Sols for everyone when AP 0.6.2 came out (and was hotfixed in 0.1.5).\r\n- I've added [the proposed apworld manifest](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/pull/4516) to nine_sols.apworld and used [the proposed apworld build tool](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/pull/5340) to create it.

For now it only affects pre-Eigong bosses that have a Battle Memories version, and uses their Battle Memories stats as a guide for how much to scale them. I expect this to be important for alt spawns, and for the scaling math to get tweaked after player feedback.\r\n- **Random Jade Costs**: New `randomize_jade_costs`, `jade_cost_min`, and `jade_cost_max` .yaml options to randomize the computing power cost of all 28 jades.\r\n- **Missing Poison**: Somehow no one noticed that I forgot to create an AP item for the \"Molted Tianma Hide\" poison. Now I've done that.\r\n- **Shennong Re-implementation**: Previously, the randomizer would completely skip Shennong's \"sick\" state, which made it impossible to get the first health upgrade. Now Shennong will become sick after you have a poison to give him, so that you can get all health upgrades from him without blocking any other FSP events on poisons.\r\n- **Loading Screen Tips**: The vanilla game's tips have been replaced with randomizer tips. For now there are only four tips, but the infrastructure is in place to let us easily add more.\r\n- Internal implementation of Wall Climb, Grapple and Ledge Grab items. For now, these items will always be in your start inventory, so they won't affect the player experience yet unless you fiddle with the mod's debug tools. Actually shuffling these items will require alt spawns (since the default spawn forces you to use two of them almost immediately), as well as updating all of the logic to use them.\r\n- Moved death link code off the websocket thread. Experience from both of my randomizer mods implies that avoiding the websocket thread helps reduces crashes, and this was the last part of the Nine Sols mod which still used the thread more than it had to.",

For now there are 10 choices, including the familiar default of AFM. Most of the other root nodes were left out because they would be \"overly restrictive starts\" (i.e. few if any locations would be checkable with no items, especially when Grapple, Ledge Grab and Wall Climb are all shuffled).\r\n\t- The upper half of AFM is unreachable from below, so the AFM root node will now be automatically unlocked whenever you first enter AFM. This solution should work even in a future version with entrance randomization.\r\n\t- The two smaller elevators in AFE become impassable barriers when AFE is entered from below, so those will be automatically unlocked whenever you first enter AFE if you enter from below instead of above. Again, this should work with future entrance randomization.\r\n\t- In the vanilla game, the large spike ball you release in GoS (East) lands in GoS (Entry), breaking open some paths and blocking others. This has now been prevented, since it's not compatible with randomizer logic and risked making a lot of Grotto spawns unbeatable.\r\n- `shuffle_grapple`, `shuffle_wall_climb` and `shuffle_ledge_grab` options.

After you have them all, he'll let you trigger the fight as usual.\r\n- The maximum value for `seals_for_ethereal` has been lowered from 8 to 7, because we discovered `seals_for_ethereal: 8` and `shuffle_sol_seals: false` (which implies putting 1 of the 8 seals behind ethereal) is an impossible combination of options to generate with. No one could think of a reason you'd actually want `seals_for_ethereal: 8`, so disallowing it was the simplest solution.\r\n- Corrected the loading tip about reaching Eigong to say Tiandao Research *Institute*, not Center.",

For technical reasons, this hack should get (almost) all of your Nine Sols mods working on current patch, as long as the Archipelago Randomizer is one of those mods. If this seems stable for us, then I'll try to update NineSolsAPI later.\r\n\t- The mods I expect to still have issues on current patch even with these hacks are: PromisedEigong, BossChallengeMod, DebugModPlus, Multiplayer and CutsceneSkip. I'll patch CutsceneSkip soon, but in the meantime expect CutsceneSkip to fail to display \"Press ... to skip\" messages on current patch.\r\n- Fixed randomized jade costs being reset to vanilla after quitting to menu and reloading the same save slot. This bug was introduced in 0.3.3 when I tried to prevent jade costs \"bleeding\" into Battle Memories mode. I've now completely reimplemented how the mod applies jade costs in a way that should properly fix both bugs.\r\n- Loading screen tips are now properly random. Turns out the vanilla game will only select one of the first three tips, so the others can only be seen by scrolling to them (on a slow enough machine that you have time to scroll).\r\n\t- Added a loading tip that you can fight Jiequan before or after Prison.\r\n- Jiequan will no longer be standing menacingly in Factory (Great Hall) after sending you to Prison.\r\n- Walking into Apeman Facility (Monitoring) from (Elevator) will now always display a message about the AF(M) node being auto-unlocked, instead of just the first time.\r\n- Logic fixes:\r\n\t- \"OW: Enemy Gauntlet Room\" now logically requires Charged Strike because the final enemy is a shielded beetle\r\n\t- Climbing the right side of Factory (PA) no longer logically requires Air Dash, since I realized you can circle around Wuqiang's arena to skip the jump I thought needed it\r\n- Updated the Archipelago.MultiClient.Net library from v6.6.1 to v6.7.0.

      "description": "For installation instructions [see the README](https://github.com/Ixrec/NineSolsArchipelagoRandomizer?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).\r\n\r\n- Jade cost randomization now works in all languages, fixing the \"endless loading screen\" problem in previous versions when jade cost rando was combined with a non-English language.\r\n- Added an in-game warning when the .apworld version that generated your slot doesn't match your mod version. There's a mild orange warning when only the patch version differs (since this is usually harmless), and a louder red warning when the major and/or minor versions differ.\r\n- Native crashes on closing the game should be fixed now. This means closing should just work without showing you the \"cat face popup\" and hanging for several seconds.\r\n- Logic changes:\r\n\t- Bugfixes (i.e. missing requirements, potentially unbeatable seeds):\r\n\t\t- Entering Cortex Center from the left exit now logically requires grapple to get anywhere.\r\n\t\t- Hacking Yinglong Canal's one way door from the left exit to the root node now logically requires one of Cloud Leap, Wall Climb or Ledge Grab.\r\n\t\t- \"CTH: Hack 2 Statues\" on ledge storage logic incorrectly had a bow hover into parry vault path for reaching the harder statue which has now been removed. This trick is feasible, but the logic was missing CL to set up LS, and once CL's added it becomes redundant with the medium logic.\r\n\t- Additions (i.e. missing \"paths\") for `logic_difficulty: vanilla`:\r\n\t\t- \"AF (Depths): Under Lower Left Exit\" can now be logically reached by nymph hacking the shortcut door from below, then falling down from above. This matters when you get nymph and AFD leftside access before grapple or cloud leap.\r\n\t- Additions (i.e. missing \"paths\") for higher difficulties (mostly `medium`):\r\n\t\t- Using Cloud Piercer S/X arrows instead of Charged Strike is now also in medium logic for the shield-holding statues in CC, LYR, FU, and FPA.\r\n\t\t- On the left side of Lake Yaochi Ruins, medium logic now includes using Swift Runner in place of Grapple.\r\n\t\t- Crossing the spike pit to the right of \"Factory (U): Find Broken Shanhai 9000\" is now in medium logic with only Cloud Leap (and Swift Runner).\r\n\t\t- In LYR, using bow hover to cross the lake from the right (i.e. the direction where you don't have the usual dragon boat) is now in medium logic, as well as parry hover in LS logic.\r\n\t\t- For the \"CTH - Under Root Node\" to \"CTH - Lower Right Vents\" connection, medium logic is now just Ledge Grab instead of Ledge Grab and Air Dash, because both paths to Under Root Node allow you to get qi for a T-dash on the way.\r\n\t\t- For the \"AFE - Upper Root Node\" to \"AFE - Enter Tutorial Arena\" connection, medium logic now includes Air Dashing onto the roof above the root node and bow hovering from there to the arena.\r\n\t- Cleanup:\r\n\t\t- The upper AF(E) connections have been refactored to explicitly represent the \"tutorial arena\", hopefully reducing confusion over what's expected there.\r\n\t\t- The connection logic for \"PRW - Root Node\" to \"PRW - Guarded Chest\" has been simplified without changing behavior; one of the \"or TCK\" conditions turned out to be redundant.\r\n- Universal Tracker support:\r\n\t- `prevent_weakened_prison_state` is now accounted for by UT.\r\n\t- Moved the map page square for \"Factory (GH): Roof Above Root Node\" onto the correct room.\r\n\t- Cleaned up some dead code (specifically the `interpret_slot_data` stub) that modern versions of UT no longer require.\r\n- Other minor bugfixes:\r\n\t- Shop unlocks on zero sol seals now work immediately, instead of waiting for you to receive an item.\r\n\t- The in-game console was failing to auto-scroll to the bottom / most recent message, but only when you had a *lot* of messages. It should now auto-scroll to the bottom no matter how many messages there are.\r\n\t- The Boss Scaling code now tracks boss encounter order even when it's turned off, so that turning the feature on and off mid-playthrough should just work now.\r\n\t- The True Ending cutscene in Galactic Dock no longer takes away your Nymph\r\n\t- Deleted \"fallback\" code for Wall Climb, Grapple and Ledge Grab that would give you those abilities without the AP item when connected to a slot generated by an apworld that predates those items. This may have been helpful at the time, but nowadays this just creates additional confusion when certain bugs and user errors happen (especially related to the FGH Jiequan/Prison sequence).",
