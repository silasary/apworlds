They can be sold or discarded. Don't do that.\r\n- Items that belong to other players currently show up as \"-\".\r\n- There is no in-game notification when receiving items from other players. Items are only received when on the map\r\n\r\n### Major issues:\r\n- Auction House softlocks (avoidable, just don't enter)\r\n- Some quests may be in unreachable locations on the map (unavoidable, let me know which quests so I can move them)\r\n\r\n### Minor issues:\r\n- Story quests are broken due to story progress reliance (removed from the pool)\r\n- Rewards are visible in the pub\r\n- Gate items can currently be used in bazaar recipes",
