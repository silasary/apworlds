They will not appear otherwise.\r\n- You are allowed to warp to any floor at the start.\r\n- Floors which you don't have unlocked are simply assigned Traverse Town.\r\n- If card packs are on (GBA ONLY), some locations hold card packs, which are the only way to obtain battle cards. These card packs come in three varieties: bronze, silver, and gold\r\n- If card sets are on, some locations locations hold sets of specific cards (Kingdom Key 4-6 for example).  These are the only way to obtain battle cards.\r\n- Friend cards (Aladdin, Ariel, Beast, Donald, Goofy, Jack, Peter Pan) are randomly placed at checks. \r\n- In GBA COM, when you have found all 7 friend cards, you win.  \r\n- In RECOM, when you have found all 7 friend cards and defeated all floor bosses, F13 is opened.  Defeat Marluxia 1 on F13 and receive the Victory item to win.\r\n- In RECOM, these friend cards are tracked in your journal instead of your inventory.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n### (RECOM) All of my cards are missing!\r\nRECOM works by parsing the items from the client in real time, you must have the client open and connected to progress.  As soon as you reconnect, you'll see your items again and won't have lost any progress. \r\n\r\n### (RECOM) I have an error on startup.\r\nIf you receive an error when starting you game, ensure that your paths in KH_1.5_2.5/LuaBackend.toml have quotes around them, both for RECOM and any other game that lists paths for scripts.  If not, please add them.\r\n\r\n### (RECOM) I want to play vanilla again.\r\nIf you want to return the game to its original state, uninstall the mod via OpenKH.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n### (GBA) Card Packs:\r\n### Bronze\r\n- Most abundant\r\n- Contains 3 cards of any numeric value of the following types: Kingdom Key, Three Wishes, Pumpkinhead, Olympia, Wishing Star, Lady Luck, Potion, Hi-Potion, Ether, Fire, Blizzard, Thunder, Simba, Genie, Cloud, Dumbo\r\n\r\n### Silver\r\n- Second most abundant\r\n- Contains 3 cards of any numeric value of the following types: Lionheart, Metal Chocobo, Spellbinder, Divine Rose, Crabclaw, Mega-Potion, Elixir, Mega-Ether, Cure, Stop, Gravity, Aero, Bambi, Mushu, Tinker Bell\r\n\r\n### Gold\r\n- Least abundant\r\n- Contains 3 cards of any numeric value of the following types: Oathkeeper, Oblivion, Diamond Dust, One-Winged Angel, Ultima Weapon, Megalixir",

They will not appear otherwise.\r\n- You are allowed to warp to any floor at the start.\r\n- Floors which you don't have unlocked are simply assigned Traverse Town.\r\n- If card packs are on (GBA ONLY), some locations hold card packs, which are the only way to obtain battle cards. These card packs come in three varieties: bronze, silver, and gold\r\n- If card sets are on, some locations locations hold sets of specific cards (Card Set Kingdom Key for example).  These are the only way to obtain battle cards.\r\n- Friend cards (Aladdin, Ariel, Beast, Donald, Goofy, Jack, Peter Pan, Pluto (RECOM)) are randomly placed at checks. \r\n- In GBA COM, when you have found all 7 friend cards, F13 is opened.

Install OpenKH and the LUA Backend. \r\n- Download the latest release of OpenKH here: https://github.com/OpenKH/OpenKh/releases/tag/latest\r\n- Extract the files to a directory of your choosing.\r\n- Open OpenKh.Tools.ModsManager.exe and run first time set up.\r\n- When prompted for game edition, choose PC Release via Epic Games Store and navigate to your KH_1.5_2.5 in the path box and click \"Next\"\r\n- When prompted, install Panacea, then click \"Next\"\r\n- When prompted, check ReCoM plus any other AP game you play (KH2) and click \"Install and configure LUA backend\", then click \"Next\".\r\n- Ensure that \"Launch via Epic Games\" is checked and click \"Next\"\r\n- Extract game data for ReCoM and any other AP game you play (KH2), then click \"Next\".\r\n- Click \"Finish\"\r\n\r\n2. Open \"OpenKh.Tools.ModsManager.exe\"\r\n3. Click the drop down menu at the top-right and choose \"Re:Chain of Memories\"\r\n4. Click Mods>Install a New Mod\r\n5. In \"Add a new mod from GitHub\" paste \"gaithern/KH-RECOM-AP-LUA\"\r\n6. Click Install\r\n7. Navigate to Mod Loader and click \"Build Only\"\r\n8. Place your khrecom.apworld file in your worlds folder (usually /lib/worlds/)\r\n9. Run ArchipelagoLauncher.exe\r\n10. Click \"Generate Template Settings\".  This will open file explorer\r\n11. Find \"Kingdom Hearts RE Chain of Memories.yaml\" and copy it to /Players/ (create this folder if it does not exist)\r\n12. Open the YAML file and change the line that says \"name: Player{number}\" to your desired player name.\r\n13. Adjust the settings in the YAML to your liking\r\n14. Run ArchipelagoGenerate.exe\r\n15. Take the newly created AP_XXX.zip file in /output/ in upload it here: https://archipelago.gg/uploads/\r\n16. Open ArchipelagoLauncher.exe\r\n17. Click \"KHRECOM Client\" and connect to your server hosted on archipelago.gg\r\n18. Play!\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n### How the randomizer works:\r\n\r\n-  You begin the game as normal in Traverse Town on Floor 1.\r\n- You start with a Key of Beginnings, Key of Guidance, and Key to Truth for Floor 1, as well as infinite (non-gold) map cards of each type and value.\r\n- Collecting battle cards in the overworld WILL NOT ADD THEM TO YOUR INVENTORY.\r\n- Opening Room of Beginnings, Room of Guidance, and Room of Truth on each floor as well as card journal entries, defeating heartless, and (optionally) acquiring sleights are checks.\r\n- You must fight the exit hall bosses in order.  They will not appear otherwise.\r\n- You are allowed to warp to any floor at the start.\r\n- Floors which you don't have unlocked are simply assigned Traverse Town.\r\n- Some locations locations hold sets of specific cards (Card Set Kingdom Key for example).  These are the only way to obtain battle cards.\r\n- Friend cards (Aladdin, Ariel, Beast, Donald, Goofy, Jack, Peter Pan, Pluto) are randomly placed at checks. \r\n- When you have found all 8 friend cards and defeated all floor bosses, F13 is opened.  Defeat Final Marluxia on F13 and receive the Victory item to win.\r\n- These friend cards are tracked in your journal instead of your inventory.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n### All of my cards are missing!\r\nRECOM works by parsing the items from the client in real time, you must have the client open and connected to progress.  As soon as you reconnect, you'll see your items again and won't have lost any progress. \r\n\r\n### I have an error on startup.\r\nIf you receive an error when starting you game, ensure that your paths in KH_1.5_2.5/LuaBackend.toml have quotes around them, both for RECOM and any other game that lists paths for scripts.  If not, please add them.\r\n\r\n### I want to play vanilla again.\r\nIf you want to return the game to its original state, uninstall the mod via OpenKH.",
