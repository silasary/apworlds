Here you'll find the AP World as well as a few libraries needed for the Dolphin interactions.\r\n\r\nPlease check out the setup within docs (https://github.com/Metaruler/ArchipelagoCR/blob/main/worlds/custom_robo/docs/setup_en.md)\r\n\r\nI've also included a test YAML, but you can generate your own using standard Archipelago Template generation\r\n\r\nKNOWN ISSUES (future fixes):\r\n\r\nThere's currently a bug if you receive multiple Rahu Evolution items in one network receive step, it will only give the highest tier part from that group and not the ones below (beating the game will still release the check from usage of that skipped item)\r\n\r\nThere is no indicator in-game when you send or receive an item, only on the AP Client.",
