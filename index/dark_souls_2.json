NPC, covenant, and other rewards are detected but not randomized for now.\r\n- **Randomized Item Pickups:** All item pickups are randomized, except for enemy drops.\r\n- **Locations:** Both Vanilla and Scholar of the First Sin locations are included. Some location items differ between versions and further testing is needed for finding and removing unused/unwanted locations.\r\n- **Game Completion Rules:** Basic rules are set to be able to reach the end of the game. The current game completion is based on killing Nashandra, with the Aldia ending not being supported yet.\r\n\r\n## Options:\r\n- **NG+ and DLCs:** These are optional and are turned off by default.\r\n- **Death Link:** Choose whether Death Link will be activated.\r\n- **Game Version:** Choose between Vanilla or Scholar of the First Sin.\r\n\r\nThis release is a work in progress and most of the testing was done in the vanilla version.",
