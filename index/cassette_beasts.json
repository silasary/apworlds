The ap file will go in the custom_worlds folder in the Archipelago files.  The pck mod will go in your Cassette Beasts mod folder generally located in `C:\\Users\\(username)\\AppData\\Roaming\\CassetteBeasts\\mods` for windows and `~/.local/share/CassetteBeasts/mods/` for linux.\r\nNOTE: This mod requires cat's mod utils mod as well and will not work without it.  It can be found on the steam workshop, Mod Utils by cat.\r\n\r\nFuture releases will use auto generated notes, but this one is so big that those notes wouldn't be useful.\r\n\r\nA non-exhaustive list of things that are supported that I can remember:\r\n- In game AP connection, which means it does not require an ap client to be open\r\n- Randomized pickups include chests, song fragments, captain stamps, and items either given by NPCs or dropped\r\n- Progressive items include song fragments, captain badges, and abilities\r\n- Some changes to the early game have been made to keep early BK from happening\r\n  - After the intro harbourtown scenes you are jumped ahead as if you had finished the intro.  This unlocks the elevator and keeps you from becoming almost instantly blocked behind the harbourtown gate key.\r\n  - You will still need to go to the subway in order to unlock it, fast travel, and get the chest inside.\r\n- Prior to starting a new game you will want to make sure that you are connected to the AP server, as you will not have access to the menu until after the harbourtown intro scenes.\r\n  - The AP settings menu is added as another tab in the settings (probably the last tab)\r\n- We put in some popups on save creation/load around the connection to the server, but they are not foolproof.",
