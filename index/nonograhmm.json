Because there is another nonogram implementation for Archipelago called \"Nonopelagram\", go check that out too!\r\n- New gimmick: even and odd numbers (enable in the yaml).\r\n- Custom grid sizes: see yaml.\r\n- Progress is now saved (last checkpoint/check).\r\n- You now only get one clue at a time.\r\n\r\nPlay this on the new website: https://nonograhmm.netlify.app/\r\n\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f I've changed many things, so please treat this as unstable and/or untested.\r\n\r\nTo do:\r\n- Add solo games to this version.",
