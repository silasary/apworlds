      "description": "# Changes since 0.5.1\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n\r\nThere are three main features whose inclusion gives this version its novelty. They are:\r\n\r\n* **Chest Lock Randomization**: This option randomizes the locks on each shuffled chest (Bronze, Silver, Gold, or None), meaning that they will require different keys than in vanilla. Probabilities can be configured.\r\n* **Progressive Equipment**:  This option replaces all shuffled equipment with progressive items, balanced into various progressive item chains of approximately equal length. Massive thanks to @Treeways, without whom this would not have happened!\r\n* **Shop Randomization**: Allows items purchased from shops to be sent as locations. Multiple modes of sending and receiving are supported and can be mixed and matched.\r\n\r\n## Changes to Mod\r\n\r\n* Added support for Chest Lock Randomization, Progressive Equipment, and Shop Randomization.\r\n* Added support to Universal Tracker for chest lock randomization.\r\n* Modify the Randomizer Start button in the New Game+ options menu to indicate that the option is always on and cannot be toggled.\r\n* (@Treeways) Patched the Quest Hub Menu to show correct icons (as defined by the randomized items)\r\n\r\n## Changes to Generation\r\n\r\n* Added support for Chest Lock Randomization, Progressive Equipment, and Shop Randomization.\r\n* Renamed most chest and cutscene location names to be a bit shorter, changing full area names to single words.\r\n\r\n## Changes to Options\r\n\r\n* **Shop Randomization** (`shop_rando`): If enabled, all shops will be added to the location list.\r\n* **Shop Send Mode** (`shop_send_mode`): Controls what exactly counts as a check when shop randomization is enabled.\r\n  * **Per Item Type** (`per_item_type`): A check is added for each type of item (for example, Sandwich). Therefore, purchasing a sandwich from any shop in the game clears the same check.\r\n  * **Per Slot** (`per_slot`)  A check is added for each item slot in each shop. Therefore, purchasing a Sandwich in Rookie Harbor clears a separate check than purchasing a Sandwich in Bergen Village.\r\n* **Shop Receive Mode** (`shop_receive_mode`): Controls how shops are unlocked when shop randomization is enabled.\r\n  * **None** (`none`): All shop slots are able to be purchased as soon as the player can access the shop.\r\n  * **Per Item Type** (`per_item_type`): A check is added for each type of item (for example, Sandwich) which unlocks the ability to purchase that item from any shop.\r\n  * **Per Shop** (`per_shop`): A check is added for each shop (for example, Rookie Harbor Items) which unlocks the ability to purchase items from that shop.\r\n  * **Per Slot** (`per_slot`): A check is added for each item slot in each shop which unlocks the ability to purchase that item from\r\nthat shop (this may lead to tedious playthroughs).\r\n* **Shop Dialog Hints** (`shop_dialog_hints`): If enabled, upon opening the dialog for a shop, corresponding hints (for progressive items only) are sent to the Archipelago server.\r\n* **Progressive Equipment** (`progressive_equipment`): If enabled, equipment will be progressive, sorted into different categories according to playstyle depending on which of the other location-adding options are enabled.\r\n* **Chest Lock Randomization** (`chest_lock_rando`): If enabled, the lock on all chests (Bronze, Silver, Gold, or None) will be randomized.\r\n* **No Chest Lock Weight** (`no_chest_lock_weight`), **Bronze Chest Lock Weight** (`bronze_chest_lock_weight`), **Silver Chest Lock Weight** (`silver_chest_lock_weight`), and **Gold Chest Lock Weight** (`gold_chest_lock_weight`): Controls the likelihood of giving a chest no lock, bronze lock, silver lock, or gold lock, respectively (if chest lock randomization is enabled).\r\n\r\n## Fixes to Mod\r\n\r\n* Fixed an issue occurring in the base game where, in analyze mode, when playing with a controller, the cursor would not be\r\n  able to reach to all corners of the screen.\r\n* Improved the performance of the networking code (technical details follow):\r\n  * Fixed an issue where, upon connecting to a multiworld, two connections would always be opened, and one of them would\r\n    not be able to be closed by any means other than closing the game.\r\n  * Fixed an issue where, upon checking a location, the full unabridged list of received items would always be sent back\r\n    to the game, despite this information not being necessary.\r\n  * Fixed an issue where, when disconnecting from a multiworld, occasionally the client would still show as connected,\r\n    and the client would become nonfunctional as a result.\r\n  * Fixed an issue where, on every screen transition, unnecessary packets would be sent indicating the player was \"playing\".\r\n    These packets are ignored by Archipelago and are therefore unnecessary.\r\n* (@Treeways) Fixed an issue where, in the Quest Dialog menu, equipment with a level would still show as having the level even if icons were set to be obscured.\r\n\r\n# Note\r\n\r\nThis mod version is intended to be **fully compatible** with worlds generated under version 0.5.X. If this is found not to be the case, consider it a bug and report it.",
