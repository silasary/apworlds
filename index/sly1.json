The Fiendish Five have scattered pages of the Thievius Raccoonus across the multiworld, and Sly will need to collect them to challenge Clockwerk. Acts as a traditional MacGuffin hunt. Note that generation may fail if you don't have spare locations through cluesanity or minigame caches.\r\n* A QoL option: Fast Clockwerk. Unlocks \"A Strange Reunion\" (the Clockwerk boss fight) on the map after CHoH is unlocked. Must be selected from the map after entering the first level.\r\n* Text replacement is temporarily deprecated due to unforeseen difficulties. In its place, the client has two commands: `/vaults`, which prints the names of levels with openable vaults, and `/check_goal`, which will print your progress towards your goal.\r\n* Various improvements to apworld logic.\r\n* Bentley Jumpscare Trap has been temporarily disabled due to copyright concerns.
