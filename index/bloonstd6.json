      "description": "# New Features\r\n- Monkeys are now randomized.  You may start with anywhere from 1 to 3 monkeys plus you can still choose heroes.\r\n\r\nI- Uhhhhh, wow that was it.  This was kinda just the next thing I wanted to do after I got it looking more polished and it was way easier than I thought it would be.  Much less headache adding more items after you know how to do it huh.\r\n\r\n# Looking Forward\r\nThis is kind of a weird segment seeing as I literally threw this together in like a couple days, but I have school coming up so I may not be able to bug fix or add new features as quickly.  But I still have ideas and plans before I finalize this repository and I still want your feedback as much as possible.\r\n\r\nAnyways here's the features that are coming in future updates:\r\n- Traps!  All sorts of visual traps I have ideas for to throw you off your game or make it harder to play.\r\n- Hero Randomization.  This one is going to take more time to implement than monkeys for the sole reason of I want to implement them as checks as well.  The first 4 heroes are included in the level up system, and everyone else is purchased with monkey money, and I kinda wanted to include the heroes screen as more locations if I were to randomize them.\r\n- Monkey Knowledge Randomization.  This ones definitely going to be a challenge without screwing up people's save files.  I have an idea of how to add hero unlocks as locations and items but Knowledge has been part of the plan from the beginning (if you noticed the monkey knowledge filler items) and its a stumper how im gonna go about this, as of current anyway.\r\n\r\nThank you for playing this randomizer.  It means a lot to me, mostly because I work on random coding projects all the time and it doesn't really go anywhere and this will be the first project that is going to have a large number of people using it.  I look forward to all the bugs and generation issues that come of this project if any.",
