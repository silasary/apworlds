In the meantime I would suggest against using it in four job mode and know that it won't have your starting crystal magic in non-four job mode*",

This allows for any item in the multiworld to appear in trapped chests.\r\n- Rift Bosses now have checks.\r\n- Kuzar and Rift/Void regions have a setting to disable or enable progression appearing in those regions.\r\n\r\n#### Fixes\r\n- Logic for CornaJar now correctly accounts for available jobs or abilities.\r\n- Logic for Hero's Song wasn't correctly accounting for world access, this has been fixed.\r\n- Only_usable_magic wasn't correctly accounting for starting crystals, which broke it in four job mode, this has been fixed.\r\n- Added an additional failsafe to hopefully prevent the very rare bug where fire crystal's checks were sent on game start.\r\n\r\n#### Adjustments\r\n- To assist with logical operations and make it harder to create impossible seeds the lower range of random job crystals and job ability groups has been adjusted up to 4\r\n- There is now some logic to guarantee a combination of a physical based class and a magic based class early in the game to prevent certain bosses soft locking the seed\r\n- Replaced some deprecated AP functions to assist with compatibility for future AP iterations\r\n- apworld no longer chonky (made sure to pull out unnecessary files this time)\r\n\r\n \r\nCheck README.txt for installations instructions.",
