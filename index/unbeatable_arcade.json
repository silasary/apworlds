(You should update the apworld ASAP too!)\r\n\r\napworld changes:\r\n- Song items now follow progression balancing, improving pacing in multiplayer lobbies\r\n- Added the \"Non-local Traps\" setting as a shorthand to add all trap items to \"Non-local Items\"\r\n- Improved the detail and clarity of several options, and improved some default values\r\n\r\nclient changes:\r\n- Fixed an issue where an out-of-range port would lock up the connection screen\r\n- Fixed an issue where the game would stop responding while connecting if many items have been collected\r\n- Fixed an issue where pressing `J` while typing in an input field would open the options menu\r\n- Fixed an ugly layout issue with the connection screen\r\n- Traps are no longer cancelled when quitting or failing a song\r\n- The effects of Zoom Traps have been reduced, and the default duration of all traps has been increased\r\n\r\nCheck [the README](https://github.com/AllPoland/unbeatAP/blob/main/README.md) for installation instructions.\r\n\r\nThe mod and apworld are both still early in development, and are not feature complete nor are there guarantees about stability.\r\n\r\n**Please read the YAML options carefully and test your options before joining a lobby**, since the pacing and difficulty of the apworld is very volatile.

      "description": "Thanks to work from @estradiol-valerate, this update brings the songs added in game patch 1.7.1 to the randomizer, as well as some songs that were already present but missing from the rando.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there are a few fixes:\r\n- Fixed an issue that caused connection to take a really long time (fixed by @estradiol-valerate)\r\n- Skill rating is now on a 1000x scale instead of a 100x scale. This should hopefully be more intuitive, since the game always displays rating with three decimal places (now a rating of 5.318 translates to skill rating 5318 in the YAML).\r\n- Removed the \"non-local traps\" option, as it caused a lot of generation failures when used. It is still possible to place traps in non-local items manually.\r\n\r\nThis update is **NOT compatible** with v0.1.x! You will have to update both the client and apworld together and generate a new game.\r\n\r\nCheck [the README](https://github.com/AllPoland/unbeatAP/blob/main/README.md) for installation instructions.\r\n\r\nThe mod and apworld are both still early in development, and are not feature complete nor are there guarantees about stability.\r\n\r\n**Please read the YAML options carefully and test your options before joining a lobby**, since the pacing and difficulty of the apworld is very volatile.
