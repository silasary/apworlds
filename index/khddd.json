Expect bugs to occur that may result in needing to use console commands to restore items or send locations.\r\n\r\n### How To Play\r\n\r\nBEFORE MODDING, PLEASE INSTALL AND RUN KHDDD AT LEAST ONCE.\r\n\r\n1. Install OpenKH and Lua Backend\r\n- Download the latest release of OpenKH here: https://github.com/OpenKH/OpenKh/releases/tag/latest\r\n- Extract the files to a directory of your choosing.\r\n- Open OpenKh.Tools.ModsManager.exe and run first time set up.\r\n- When prompted for game edition, choose PC, choose which platform you are playing on (**Only Steam is supported right now**), navigate to your KH 2.8 installation folder in the path box, then click \"Next\".\r\n- When prompted, install Panacea. Make sure you have the Kingdom Hearts 2.8 collection selected, then click \"Next\".\r\n- When prompted, check KH3D and click \"Install and Configure Lua Backend\" then click \"Next\".\r\n- Extracting game data for KHDDD is unnecessary.\r\n- Click \"Finish\".\r\n\r\n2. Open \"OpenKH.Tools.ModsManager.exe\r\n3. Click the drop down menu at the top-right and choose \"Dream Drop Distance\"\r\n4. Click Mods>Install a New Mod\r\n5. In \"Add a new mod from GitHub\", paste \"LuxMake/KHDDD-AP\"\r\n6. Click Install\r\n7. Navigate to Mod Loader and click \"Build Only\"\r\n8. Double-click the \"khddd.apworld\" file to install it to your custom_worlds folder\r\n9. Run ArchipelagoLauncher.exe\r\n10. Click \"Generate Template Options\". This will open the file explorer\r\n11. Find \"Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance.yaml\" and copy it to /Players/\r\n12. Open the YAML file and change the line that says \"name: Player{number}\" to your desired player name\r\n13. Adjust the settings in the YAML to your liking\r\n14. Run ArchipelagoGenerate.exe or click \"Open\" under the Generate option in the Archipelago Launcher\r\n15. Take the newly created AP_XXX.zip file in /output/ in upload it here: https://archipelago.gg/uploads\r\n16. Open ArchipelagoLauncher.exe\r\n17. Click \"KHDDD Client\". Once the client launches, you will see a message in the console stating \"Searching for KHDDD Client...Please load your save file before connecting.\"\r\n18. In OpenKH, click \"Mod Loader\", then \"Build and Run\"\r\n19. Once the game launches, start a New Game (or load a save file if applicable)\r\n20. After starting the game, a new message will appear in the Archipelago client stating \"KHDDD Game Client Found\". Once this message appears, you can connect to the server hosted on archipelago.gg\r\n21. Play\r\n\r\n### Additional Notes\r\n- The save file in-game should be loaded before attempting to connect to the server in the AP client. Otherwise, you will get an error message when pressing \"Connect\".\r\n- Conversely, the game will stutter trying to find the AP client if the save file is loaded before the AP client is launched. So the ideal setup is to: Launch AP client -> Load save file -> Connect to AP server. Future updates will aim to streamline this process.\r\n- If either the game or the AP client have to be closed for any reason, it is recommended to completely close out of both clients to ensure stability.",

Game no longer has to be loaded to connect to AP.\r\n- Fixed Recipe options. All 54 recipes can be included in the item pool and be required for game completion.\r\n- Fixed some logic issues.\r\n\r\n### AP Companion Changes\r\n- New Recipe item. This item is placed at the bottom of inventory and tracks how many total recipes have been obtained as well as how many are needed to beat the seed.\r\n- Re-receive spirits if the player is defeated before being able to room save them.\r\n- Tweaked Deathlink code to prevent sending Deathlinks when receiving them.\r\n- Game client now checks to see if items have already been received before requesting all of them.\r\n- Made an attempt to prevent the player from entering \"purgatory rooms\". This fix is largely untested because I could not reliably reproduce the issue. Should not interfere with standard gameplay.",

Be sure to update the mod in OpenKH if using the latest AP World.***\r\n\r\nThis update does not contain many gameplay changes, but it is aimed at greatly improving the current stability of the mod.\r\n\r\n### APWorld Changes\r\n- Refactored a lot of the code behind the AP <-> Game communication. Items can be received instantly, and the clients do not need to be restarted when one client has to be closed/disconnected (It is still recommended to fully close out of both clients if switching slots). Huge thanks to Delilah and Shananas for helping with the refactor.\r\n- Fixed an issue where character-exclusive commands would not appear in duo-character seeds.\r\n- Fixed an issue where regions would be inaccessible when generating a multiworld with multiple DDD slots.\r\n- Minor logic improvement for Riku TWTNW.\r\n- Added manifest file.\r\n\r\n### AP Companion Changes\r\n- Socket improvements for communication refactor.\r\n- Force Riku's next TT cutscene to trigger on room transition if the Spirit Crafting skip does not work correctly.\r\n- Fixed an issue where Riku's TT1 is inaccessible.\r\n- Fixed an issue where Memory's Skyscraper is inaccessible.\r\n- Fixed an issue where Air Slide may not be equippable.\r\n- Removed another Purgatory Room.",
