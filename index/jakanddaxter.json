This APWORLD update does _**not**_ come with a new mod update, so your experience playing an AP game should be the exact same as it was before.\r\n    * This update will not prevent you from falling back to the old Mod Launcher if you need to for a currently running async game.\r\n    * Keep in mind, the new Launcher may reset your in-game settings and save games, so you may need to set those back up again.\r\n* **Fixed a bug in the Client where install paths with spaces would fail to launch the powershell windows for the game and the compiler.**\r\n* **Introduced \"Friendly Limits\" to the player options.** \r\n    * Extreme values would lead to seed generation slowdowns and failures. These limits apply to both singleplayer and multiplayer seeds, though they have different limits. When you exceed these limits, a message is shown in `generate_early` to warn you as soon as possible. \r\n    * These can be overridden by a new host.yaml setting:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n  # Enforce friendly player options in both single and multiplayer seeds. Disabling this allows for\r\n  # more disruptive and challenging options, but may impact seed generation. Use at your own risk!\r\n  enforce_friendly_options: true\r\n  ```    \r\n\r\n* **Exempt's Code Review Updates** by @massimilianodelliubaldini in https://github.com/ArchipelaGOAL/Archipelago/pull/43\r\n    * Optimized logic for recalculating reachable and tradable orbs.\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/ArchipelaGOAL/Archipelago/compare/alpha-v0.0.10...alpha-v0.0.11",

The item pool is filled with green eco pills as filler in their place.\r\n### Fixed Snowy Fort Gate and Citadel Sages (https://github.com/ArchipelaGOAL/Archipelago/issues/23).\r\n  - The snowy fort gate used to open when pressing the fort gate switch button. Now, this no longer occurs. \r\n  - The gate used to not open when receiving the item while standing in front of it. You needed to reload the level by dying, leaving and returning, or reloading a save. Now, the gate opens by itself in real-time if you receive the item while standing in front of it.\r\n  - All the same fixes have been applied to the final staircase and final elevator in Citadel with regard to the \"Freed the Sage\" items.\r\n### Debug text has been removed from the game - it now _looks_ like you're playing the retail release of the game. \r\n  - You should no longer see `AS: UNKNOWN ID` and other odd text elements on screen. \r\n  - You should still be able to skip cutscenes by pressing Triangle.\r\n### Documentation has been updated to list the moves being randomized, along with the orb caches that now act as location checks.\r\n\r\n### Huge thanks to everyone who helped map out regions for Move Rando!\r\n  - Lone\r\n  - JacobMix\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/ArchipelaGOAL/Archipelago/compare/alpha-v0.0.4...alpha-v0.0.5",

Please update the mod before using this version!**\r\n\r\n## Traps!\r\n![source-1841320496](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b247460-9b6b-49ae-bd4a-5b7dba4a3266)\r\n\r\n- **Traps have been added to the game!**\r\n- **New Options have been added for traps!** Please remember to regenerate your template YAML from the Launcher! \r\n- When creating your player YAML, you can choose which traps you want to generate with your seed, how many there will be, and how long they last. \r\n- There are a total of 14 unique trap effects! See the world guide for more information on how they work. (Or go in blind!)\r\n\r\n## Item and Location Logical Changes\r\n- **The 3 orb caches in Citadel are now Locations!** Don't forget to check them from now on!\r\n- The last 2 orbs on Geyser Rock were moved to the cliff sub-region, so you are not forced to catch them with only blue eco and single jump.\r\n- Sentinel Beach's two scout fly ridges were made accessible with any Uppercut and Jump Kick (using the vertical logs).\r\n- A scout fly in Sentinel Beach was made accessible with open blue eco and single jump (from the Flut Flut egg).\r\n- A scout fly in Spider Cave was made accessible with open blue eco and single jump (from the swinging pole course).\r\n- Dark Cave's 5 precursor orbs are now properly locked behind the area's movement requirements.\r\n- Snowy Mountain's movement rules have been optimized: most long gaps require Double Jump + Jump Kick, or Roll Jump.\r\n- Lost Precursor City's Second Slide and Helix Chamber had a logic bug fixed.\r\n\r\n## Client Changes\r\n- The Precursor Orb icon will render properly in the Launcher, starting from AP 0.6.0 onward.\r\n- Fixed non-ASCII characters in item names. If the game tries to say you sent \"SIEGBR\u00c4U\" to another player, it would crash the REPL client. Thank you Dark Souls.\r\n- Host.yaml errors have better descriptions.\r\n\r\n## ArchipelaGOAL Mod Changes\r\n- The mod had been updated to the latest version of Mod Base. The sound issues with overly loud victory animations on Flut Flut and the zoomer have been fixed.\r\n- **The title screen of the game now has more info after you connect.** While it processes items from the Archipelago server it will say `Please Wait...`, and when it is done it will say `Ready!`, so you don't have to guess when it is ok to continue. If no items need to be processed, it will go straight to `Ready!`\r\n- **Your player name and the first 8 digits of the seed number will be saved on each save file,** so it is easier to remember which file you were using when returning to a game. Whitespace and invalid characters have to be trimmed from your name for this to work, so choose names with care.\r\n- **The item messages colors now match the colors of the Jak client:** blue for important items, green for filler items, and red for traps. Other players' items will always be blue (except for traps).\r\n\r\n## World and Miscellaneous Changes\r\n- Added per-region location groups (thank you @t-rbernard! [#64](https://github.com/ArchipelaGOAL/Archipelago/pull/64)).\r\n- Option descriptions are more concise.\r\n- Item generation was simplified, and generating filler items was made more robust.\r\n- Option communication from the client to the game was made more robust.\r\n- The `JakAndDaxterGame` log file is now date and time stamped, so it will not overwrite itself.\r\n- A bug report page has been added to the Web World.\r\n- Python 3.8 compatibility code was removed.\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/ArchipelaGOAL/Archipelago/compare/beta-v0.4.1...beta-v0.5.0",
