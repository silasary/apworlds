Since the items are not actually withheld from the player,\nthe player must manually refrain from using these gathered items until the tracker shows that they have been acquired or sent.",

Notated as \"Linear\" and \"Open\" in the YAML, respectively.\r\n- 6 difficulty combinations\r\n- 54 story levels (18 per difficulty option), each to be sent before it can be played. (Aztec and Egyptian currently unavailable in either mode)\r\n- 183 mission objectives among all 3 difficulties\r\n- 69 key locations (23 per difficulty)\r\n- 42 intel locations (14 per difficulty)\r\n- 18 target times/cheat unlocks\r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT:** If you opt to play a solo linear run, you will need to enable objectives and keys+intel due to there being more items than locations otherwise. This limitation is removed if generated in a multiworld with adequate filler items.",
