This makes it more unlikely to\r\n    lose a freshly created character on connection problems. Note that\r\n    the game will still freeze when aborting connection on new game\r\n    (not on loading).\r\n  * The game now only asks for connection info on a new game and again\r\n    when connecting failed or the room seed changed. If the last attempt\r\n    was successful, it reuses the old data. This makes reloading ingame\r\n    more convenient as there is still a (hard to get rid of) reconnect\r\n    on restoring the game to a previous state.\r\n* Various fixes and code structure changes\r\n* First try of getting a bit of structure / balance into the item placement (WIP)",

The item placement should be much better now and the APWorld should now respect overall multiworld progress. No more early required items behind lategame checks or deadlocks. In general, the generator should now respect higher level locations as well as later main quest steps being locked behind earlier progress. Note that at least in case of levels, all progress is \"soft blocked\" - nothing prevents the player from power levelling without receiving stat up items from other worlds, it just gets harder and harder as they progress ahead of logic. But that is just the nature of the game, and I think it's fine. The only hard blocks are coming from main quests needing unlock items.\r\n* Filler inventory items are now randomly chosen from the games population tables. You can now retrieve anything, from garbage to high tier gear (instead of just the couple of placeholder items from before). This comes with the price that the AP location names are not indicating which ingame item has been received anymore.\r\n* Traps now include a couple of creature party spawns. Like the grenade traps, these are completely random (from a chosen set) and might be very dangerous, so you might have to run away at times.\r\n* Updated the [README](https://github.com/lonesurv1vor/CavesOfQudArchipelagoRandomizer/README.md) (please read!)",
