Easy tricks gets tall jump to make retrying easier.\r\n    - Oogle Boogle Jiggy: Requires talon trot to reach the Claw Clamber Boots, as well as a way to pass the Area 51 gate.\r\n    - TDL Train Switch: Can be gotten with tall jump + grip grab. If not on intended logic, can be gotten with tall jump + air rat-a-tat-rap, or springy step shoes.\r\n    - T-Rex Roar: fixed bug that caused the check to always be in logic.\r\n    - Loggo Cheato page: If using the intended logic, unblocking Loggo with bill drill is required. Other logics can also use grenades, beak barge, breegull bash, or Pack Whack.\r\n    - Twinklies Packaging Jiggy: considers bringing Kazooie to the boiler plant into the logic. Intended logic requires turbo trainers. Other logics require turbo trainers if doing it as BK is in logic.\r\n    - Floor 2 to Floor 3: checks for the flight pad if using the washing machine for the flight pad switch. Hard tricks and glitches logic can damage boost as the washing machine to the floor 4 warp pad then escape as BK with springy step shoes.\r\n    - Boggy Jiggy: sliding into the water as you poop a clockwork for invincibility is in glitched logic.\r\n    - Hot Pool Jinjo: same as above.\r\n    - HFP Trebleclef: if you climb Icicle Grotto as Banjo-Kazooie, it will require moves for you to be able to cross the last gaps on the icicles. Also, the clockwork shot in tricks and glitches logics now require egg aim.\r\n  - Open Backdoor YAML Option\r\n    - Makes side entrances easier to traverse...if you got the right moves.\r\n    - Opens many one way switches on game start, allowing for more backdoor access to levels.\r\n      The following gates are preopened: MT>TDL, MT>HFP, GGM>WW, WW>TDL\r\n      For MT>TDL only the gate accessed from TDL's side is opened and for GGM>WW the boulders are still unexploded\r\n      The bridge from HFPs entrance is pre-moved to allow secondary access to clifftop\r\n      George is also pre-dropped to make HFP>JRL more accessible\r\n  - Kill banjo if you get stuck using L+R+C Down (Doesn't trigger deathlink)\r\n  - D-pad right will show which level as on which entrance.",

It may return in the future.\r\n    - Honey B Rewards: can now be gotten by getting the Claw Clamber Boots from Cliff Top.\r\n    - Cactus of Strength Jinjo: removed climb + talon trot + air rat-a-tat rap from easy tricks because it was too hard.\r\n    - Bunch of Logic fixes.\r\n  - We are temporarily supporting Bizhawk 2.9.1 until the next Archipelago major release is out.
