Note that some maps, due to not looking very good when shuffled, have some/no palette changes. This, at this point, is intentional.\r\n* Enemy Lifeup can no longer scale above Beta\r\n## Fixes ##\r\n* Fixed a bug where you would gain $1 upon dying if the one's digit of your money was odd\r\n* Fixed more minor text bugs when buying shopsanity items\r\n* PROBABLY* fixed some random and somewhat rare sprite corruption when buying your own photograph or sending/receiving gifts\r\n* Fixed a lack of a line break when getting money for yourself from NPCs sometimes\r\n* Fixed money on the dalaam throne check not despawning when collected\r\n* Fixed some palette flag stuff breaking\r\n* Fixed a bug where the Summers Museum guy wouldn't actually check if you had the Tiny Ruby if Poo was in the party\r\n* Fixed PSI Blast/PSI missile not clearing that they were reflected causing attack weirdness\r\n## Known Issues ##\r\n* None so Far",
