The logical minimum to complete the game is having those five buildings, but some other buildings are declared as progressive, if they speed up the gameplay by a lot or are required for achievements.\r\n### Options\r\n- Goal (Vanilla, MAM, Even fasterer, Efficiency III)\r\n- Goal amount (range)\r\n- Required shapes multiplier (range)\r\n- Randomize level requirements (bool)\r\n- Randomize upgrade requirements (bool)\r\n- Randomize level logic (vanilla, shuffled, stretched vanilla, stretched shuffled, hardcore)\r\n- Randomize upgrade logic (vanilla-like, linear, hardcore)\r\n- Same late upgrade requirements (bool)\r\n- Traps percentage (range)\r\n## Client mod\r\n- Everything already mentioned in \"APWorld\" implemented\r\n- Input box for connecting with the server in main menu\r\n- Simple windmill shape patches can generate near spawn\r\n## Is the mod compatible with multiworlds that were generated with older versions?\r\nNo, because there are no older versions",
