      "description": "# Fixes \r\n- FINALLY fixed generating a patch outside of source builds. Huge thank you to Silvris for giving the fix for this issue. Generation time is also sped up drastically thanks to this. \r\n- Fixed issue where randomization of units, missions etc. would be the same across multiple FFTA worlds in the same multiworld.\r\n- Fixed missions getting removed from worlds when totema mission unlock is selected across multiple FFTA worlds causing generation failures.\r\n\r\n# Additions / features:\r\n- Updated to new options API\r\n- New balanced starter unit randomization option. This option guarantees two physical attackers, two mages and two support as the starting units. Excludes morpher, gadgeteer and beastmaster. \r\n- Consumables are added as filler items\r\n- Laws and judges are added in as an option. No law randomization currently, option to toggle on and off. Defaults to on.\r\n- Judge units like those in Decision Time aren't randomized anymore. \r\n- Dispatch missions are added as an option. Adds 188 dispatch missions for a total of 376 new locations. They can be selected from a range of 0 to 6 per gate. \r\n- Dispatch mission gate option where dispatch missions have their own item locked gate sequence alongside the encounter mission gate.\r\n- New option to set the quick options to on or off by default. Fast text, no attack names, no exp popup etc. Quick options were previously always on. \r\n- New option to force every mission to give a new recruit.\r\n- New option to set starting gil amount\r\n- New option for branching mission gate paths. Up to three. Should help a bit with the serious bottlenecking of higher gate counts.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Additional notes:\r\n- The league missions and immunity pass are temporarily removed from the mission pool until their quirks are figured out. \r\n- Max mission gate count is lowered to 28 temporarily.  \r\n- Job unlock items are temporarily removed due to causing issues. Will be added back in when fixed.\r\n\r\nThank you to all the playtesters!",

Needs more testing to be sure - Thanks to wjg999 for pointing this out and Darthatron and Miona for the fix. \r\n\r\n- Fixed dispatch missions being very incorrect in higher mission gates from off by one error that accumulated. \r\n\r\n- Max gate count lowered to 27 temporarily to prevent generation crashes on max settings with dispatch gates turned on. \r\n\r\n- Fixed example yaml to show progressive shop tier example more clearly. \r\n\r\n- Fixed random equip option not working correctly with vanilla job option. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Features:\r\n- Job unlock items V2 is here! All job unlock items now have a different item icon. \r\nWhite mage job unlock item will unlock white mage for every supported race etc.  Should hopefully work better than the first iteration.\r\n\r\n- Ability randomization is added. All jobs can now be randomized to have different abilities. Currently doesn't apply to monsters\r\nor special units. Option to include abilities from monsters, special units, and even Totema.\r\n\r\n- New option to set the amount of AP each ability requires. Set to 0 if you want every job including recruits\r\nand enemies to already know every ability. Helps remove the grind for building up new units.\r\n\r\n- New option to toggle shop upgrade behavior to allow the numbers of battles to unlock the first two shop tiers - @Rurusachi\r\n\r\n- Starting units and enemies in enemy rando now equip reaction or support abilities if they have learned them. \r\nWorks with ability rando as well. Doesn't include monster units currently.\r\n\r\n- Random unit names are now pulled from player names in the multiworld. Supports up to 500 of your closest friends! You might find them\r\nas an ally or have to confront them as an enemy. \r\n\r\n- New option to include monsters in the recruitment pool. \r\n\r\n- Added functionality for starting inventory to work correctly. \r\n\r\n- Added option for job stat growth. Can currently choose vanilla or average (every stat is average growth for every job) with more options planned later\r\n\r\n- Added path and gate number to hints under entrance column to better gauge when that item can be received. - Thanks to Facet for the suggestion",
