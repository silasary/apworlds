      "description": "# https://autopelago.app\r\n\r\nThe game client has been completely rewritten from scratch. It runs in the browser now.\r\n\r\nThe .apworld now has a manifest, but has otherwise not changed.\r\n\r\n# Features temporarily removed since 0.10.4\r\n\r\nThis rewrite was dragging on for way too long. Instead of trying to get 100% parity with the native version, I've temporarily removed two features that aren't going to be ready for a little while:\r\n\r\n1. You can't customize your rat\r\n2. Clicking the rat won't show the path to its target\r\n\r\nOtherwise, everything from the original native version *should* be present in this one. If not, then that's a bug. Please report it.\r\n\r\n# Other changes since 0.10.4\r\n\r\n1. You no longer need to run any native executable files. It's a web app now, so just go to that URL.\r\n   - If you want to self-host it, it's all static files - this release should have a  \"dist.zip\" asset that you can just drop into any reasonable static web server.\r\n   - You will **need** to self-host if you want it to work with an Archipelago server that doesn't use HTTPS.\r\n2. You can now launch directly to the game if you know all the magical things to type into the URL fragment. This is mostly provided so you can refresh the page without having to click through the menu again.\r\n3. As is web tradition, most errors that happen when the game is running will not automatically take you out of the game screen. Instead, they will just create banners along the top that you have to click to dismiss. Hopefully, this will never happen to you (of course, it happened to me constantly while developing this).\r\n4. Not only is this a web app (and so it finally runs on Mac and Android), but it's a **progressive** web app. This means that you can \"install\" it as a native app on Android, even.\r\n5. Interval between \"when STILL blocked\" messages is now configurable (though it's still got a minimum of 15 minutes so that you don't spam everyone).\r\n6. There's now a separate \"Connecting...\" screen between the settings page and the main game screen, instead of showing a version of the game screen instantly and then modifying it once you're finally connected.\r\n7. When you get disconnected for any reason (other than clicking the button to go back to the menu), you now get spat back to the same \"Connecting...\" screen (with a different message) and it will try to reconnect you automatically, at least once every 30 seconds.\r\n8. The game version is now visible in the title bar and on the game screen. This is more relevant here because browsers like to cache way too much stuff.\r\n9. Somewhat redesigned the layout of the game screen to be a bit clearer. Instead of shorthand \"RAT\" / \"NOM\" / etc., we have a \"RATS: ##\" expander, and then all the active buffs / debuffs are visible with their full names under it. This takes up a lot of screen space, so you can collapse it to just show the rat count.\r\n10. The left panel can also shrink MUCH more than before.\r\n11. The position of the grid separator is now saved between runs.\r\n12. If your slot has an alias, we now show that (without the parenthetical slot name) instead of always just showing the official slot name.\r\n13. Chat commands can now be addressed to the rat's alias (with or without the parenthetical slot name) instead of always having to be its slot name, provided that nobody else in the room has picked the same alias.\r\n14. Added a simple chat tab to just send / receive messages in the room, so that you don't HAVE to flip back and forth. It's not quite as fancy as the standard text client, but it should be good enough.\r\n15. Elements that you can interact with all support tab-focusing, and the tooltips as well.\r\n16. When a lot of things happen all at once that the game hasn't animated yet, the app will try to play back everything that happened. This was important when moving to a web app, because browsers don't render things when the tab is in the background or minimized, so when you come back, a LOT of things could have changed. In fact, when LOTS of things changed, it speeds up the playback up to 5x so that you can \"catch up\" to the current state more quickly.\r\n17. When clicking on an item in the panel to request a hint, the confirmation box now shows up right next to it instead of in the middle of the screen.\r\n18. The \"u win.\" screen now just covers a *part* of the map instead of taking you all the way out.",

      "description": "# https://autopelago.app\r\n\r\nThe game client has been completely rewritten from scratch. It runs in the browser now.\r\n\r\nThe .apworld now has a manifest, but has otherwise not changed.\r\n\r\n# Changes since 0.11.0\r\n\r\n1. Fixed an oversight where the self-host bundle was still expecting to run on `https://autopelago.app`\r\n2. Add a discriminator to the beginning of the title for the benefit of those with multiple tabs\r\n\r\n# Features temporarily removed since 0.10.4\r\n\r\nThis rewrite was dragging on for way too long. Instead of trying to get 100% parity with the native version, I've temporarily removed two features that aren't going to be ready for a little while:\r\n\r\n1. You can't customize your rat\r\n3. Clicking the rat won't show the path to its target\r\n\r\nOtherwise, everything from the original native version *should* be present in this one. If not, then that's a bug. Please report it.\r\n\r\n# Other changes since 0.10.4\r\n\r\n1. You no longer need to run any native executable files. It's a web app now, so just go to that URL.\r\n   - If you want to self-host it, it's all static files - this release should have a  \"dist.zip\" asset that you can just drop into any reasonable static web server.\r\n   - You will **need** to self-host if you want it to work with an Archipelago server that doesn't use HTTPS.\r\n3. You can now launch directly to the game if you know all the magical things to type into the URL fragment. This is mostly provided so you can refresh the page without having to click through the menu again.\r\n4. As is web tradition, most errors that happen when the game is running will not automatically take you out of the game screen. Instead, they will just create banners along the top that you have to click to dismiss. Hopefully, this will never happen to you (of course, it happened to me constantly while developing this).\r\n5. Not only is this a web app (and so it finally runs on Mac and Android), but it's a **progressive** web app. This means that you can \"install\" it as a native app on Android, even.\r\n6. Interval between \"when STILL blocked\" messages is now configurable (though it's still got a minimum of 15 minutes so that you don't spam everyone).\r\n7. There's now a separate \"Connecting...\" screen between the settings page and the main game screen, instead of showing a version of the game screen instantly and then modifying it once you're finally connected.\r\n8. When you get disconnected for any reason (other than clicking the button to go back to the menu), you now get spat back to the same \"Connecting...\" screen (with a different message) and it will try to reconnect you automatically, at least once every 30 seconds.\r\n9. The game version is now visible in the title bar and on the game screen. This is more relevant here because browsers like to cache way too much stuff.\r\n10. Somewhat redesigned the layout of the game screen to be a bit clearer. Instead of shorthand \"RAT\" / \"NOM\" / etc., we have a \"RATS: ##\" expander, and then all the active buffs / debuffs are visible with their full names under it. This takes up a lot of screen space, so you can collapse it to just show the rat count.\r\n11. The left panel can also shrink MUCH more than before.\r\n12. The position of the grid separator is now saved between runs.\r\n13. If your slot has an alias, we now show that (without the parenthetical slot name) instead of always just showing the official slot name.\r\n14. Chat commands can now be addressed to the rat's alias (with or without the parenthetical slot name) instead of always having to be its slot name, provided that nobody else in the room has picked the same alias.\r\n15. Added a simple chat tab to just send / receive messages in the room, so that you don't HAVE to flip back and forth. It's not quite as fancy as the standard text client, but it should be good enough.\r\n16. Elements that you can interact with all support tab-focusing, and the tooltips as well.\r\n17. When a lot of things happen all at once that the game hasn't animated yet, the app will try to play back everything that happened. This was important when moving to a web app, because browsers don't render things when the tab is in the background or minimized, so when you come back, a LOT of things could have changed. In fact, when LOTS of things changed, it speeds up the playback up to 5x so that you can \"catch up\" to the current state more quickly.\r\n18. When clicking on an item in the panel to request a hint, the confirmation box now shows up right next to it instead of in the middle of the screen.\r\n19. The \"u win.\" screen now just covers a *part* of the map instead of taking you all the way out.",

Fix an oversight where the self-host bundle was still expecting to run on `https://autopelago.app`\r\n20. Add a discriminator to the beginning of the title for the benefit of those with multiple tabs\r\n21. #129: Bring back the ability to show the path to the target by clicking on the rat.\r\n22. Fix a minor issue where the rat would face its ultimate target instead of the next location along the route to it.\r\n23. Fix an issue where the rat would go to the nearest user-requested location instead of going in order of when they were requested.\r\n24. (After the failed v0.11.2) probably fix a calculation error in the \"show path\" calculation?\r\n25. #130: Bring back the ability to personalize your rat.\r\n26. Replace Pixi.js with native elements, which should unblock those getting the error \"`CanvasRenderer` is not yet implemented\". This also probably brings with it a mixed bag of performance penalties and performance improvements.\r\n27. Fix several ways in which the page could look self-inconsistent while the rat is still catching up to where the server is.\r\n28. Correcte the size of the \"Personalize Your Rat!\" button on the main page for non-Firefox browsers.\r\n29. Remove a brief flicker of the \"Personalize Your Rat!\" window's header text. It might still sometimes shift, but generally shouldn't have any frames where the text goes outside the window like it did.\r\n30. Add tooltips for the filler squares to show their names, exactly the same as tooltips for landmarks.\r\n31. Add information about known hints onto these tooltips.\r\n32. Move some quest markers out of the way so that they no longer overlap filler squares.\r\n33. Shrink landmark images so that they don't crowd their filler squares.\r\n34. Extra-shrink the hitboxes around the quest markers to make their nearby filler squares easier to get to.\r\n35. Add the ability to \"hyper-focus\" a location by clicking on it (or pressing Enter on it if you are tabbing through with your keyboard). This \"hyper-focus\" can only be adjusted by interacting with it in the browser (no chat commands supported, by design) for multiple reasons.\r\n36. #134: Fix an issue where the rat's focused location(s) would get cleared \u2014 even if the location wasn't checked \u2014 if it happened to land on the location without any actions remaining to make an attempt at checking it.\r\n37. Fix an oversight from 0.11.5 where the animation checkboxes did nothing.\r\n    - In addition to restoring the original few things that these checkboxes control:\r\n        1. Transitions on Food/Energy/Luck bars will be animated (or not) according to the player animation checkbox.\r\n        2. Tile examples in the tooltips and the \"u win.\" dialog will be animated (or not) along with the tiles, synchronized to the same frame.\r\n        3. The dashed line showing the path from the rat to its target location will be animated (or not) according to the player animation checkbox.\r\n        4. The rat token will animate its movement from one location to the next (or not) according to the player animation checkbox.\r\n        5. On systems where the user has indicated a [preference for \"reduced motion\"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/At-rules/@media/prefers-reduced-motion#user_preferences), the two checkboxes will be unchecked by default.\r\n38. #143: Stop automatically reconnecting after getting disconnected. This has been resurrecting rooms that had previously timed out, which is rude. Some version of this MAY come back in the future, if I can find a way to detect when it would be OK.\r\n39. #142: The dashed path to the rat's current target will no longer get misaligned and shrunk on games that don't go all the way to Snakes on a Planet.\r\n40. #138: The sidebar now has an extra spot at the beginning that shows the number of all rats. This lets you do the same stuff that the other icons in this panel let you do: click to hint for any rat (i.e., any item in the \"Rats\" item group) and hover over it to see a tooltip with all the hinted rat locations.\r\n41. Because I kept getting annoyed while testing the previous one, tooltips now stay around when the cursor goes inside them instead of needing the cursor to stay inside the original trigger box. This means that you can now highlight text from these tooltips with your mouse and copy-paste.",

Instead of trying to get 100% parity with the native version, I've temporarily removed two features that aren't going to be ready for a little while:\r\n\r\n1. You can't customize your rat\r\n2. ~~Clicking the rat won't show the path to its target~~ implemented in 0.11.2\r\n\r\nOtherwise, everything from the original native version *should* be present in this one. If not, then that's a bug. Please report it.\r\n\r\n# Other changes since 0.10.4\r\n\r\n1. You no longer need to run any native executable files. It's a web app now, so just go to that URL.\r\n   - If you want to self-host it, it's all static files - this release should have a  \"dist.zip\" asset that you can just drop into any reasonable static web server.\r\n   - You will **need** to self-host if you want it to work with an Archipelago server that doesn't use HTTPS.\r\n2. You can now launch directly to the game if you know all the magical things to type into the URL fragment. This is mostly provided so you can refresh the page without having to click through the menu again.\r\n3. As is web tradition, most errors that happen when the game is running will not automatically take you out of the game screen. Instead, they will just create banners along the top that you have to click to dismiss. Hopefully, this will never happen to you (of course, it happened to me constantly while developing this).\r\n4. Not only is this a web app (and so it finally runs on Mac and Android), but it's a **progressive** web app. This means that you can \"install\" it as a native app on Android, even.\r\n5. Interval between \"when STILL blocked\" messages is now configurable (though it's still got a minimum of 15 minutes so that you don't spam everyone).\r\n6. There's now a separate \"Connecting...\" screen between the settings page and the main game screen, instead of showing a version of the game screen instantly and then modifying it once you're finally connected.\r\n7. When you get disconnected for any reason (other than clicking the button to go back to the menu), you now get spat back to the same \"Connecting...\" screen (with a different message) and it will try to reconnect you automatically, at least once every 30 seconds.\r\n8. The game version is now visible in the title bar and on the game screen. This is more relevant here because browsers like to cache way too much stuff.\r\n9. Somewhat redesigned the layout of the game screen to be a bit clearer. Instead of shorthand \"RAT\" / \"NOM\" / etc., we have a \"RATS: ##\" expander, and then all the active buffs / debuffs are visible with their full names under it. This takes up a lot of screen space, so you can collapse it to just show the rat count.\r\n10. The left panel can also shrink MUCH more than before.\r\n11. The position of the grid separator is now saved between runs.\r\n12. If your slot has an alias, we now show that (without the parenthetical slot name) instead of always just showing the official slot name.\r\n13. Chat commands can now be addressed to the rat's alias (with or without the parenthetical slot name) instead of always having to be its slot name, provided that nobody else in the room has picked the same alias.\r\n14. Added a simple chat tab to just send / receive messages in the room, so that you don't HAVE to flip back and forth. It's not quite as fancy as the standard text client, but it should be good enough.\r\n15. Elements that you can interact with all support tab-focusing, and the tooltips as well.\r\n16. When a lot of things happen all at once that the game hasn't animated yet, the app will try to play back everything that happened. This was important when moving to a web app, because browsers don't render things when the tab is in the background or minimized, so when you come back, a LOT of things could have changed. In fact, when LOTS of things changed, it speeds up the playback up to 5x so that you can \"catch up\" to the current state more quickly.\r\n17. When clicking on an item in the panel to request a hint, the confirmation box now shows up right next to it instead of in the middle of the screen.\r\n18. The \"u win.\" screen now just covers a *part* of the map instead of taking you all the way out.",

      "description": "# https://autopelago.app\r\n\r\nThe game client has been completely rewritten from scratch. It runs in the browser now.\r\n\r\nThe .apworld now has a manifest, but has otherwise not changed since 0.10.3.\r\n\r\n# Changes since 0.11.6\r\n\r\n1. Fix an oversight from 0.11.5 where the animation checkboxes did nothing.\r\n\r\nIn addition to restoring the original few things that these checkboxes control:\r\n\r\n1. Transitions on Food/Energy/Luck bars will be animated (or not) according to the player animation checkbox.\r\n2. Tile examples in the tooltips and the \"u win.\" dialog will be animated (or not) along with the tiles, synchronized to the same frame.\r\n3. The dashed line showing the path from the rat to its target location will be animated (or not) according to the player animation checkbox.\r\n4. The rat token will animate its movement from one location to the next (or not) according to the player animation checkbox.\r\n5. On systems where the user has indicated a [preference for \"reduced motion\"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/At-rules/@media/prefers-reduced-motion#user_preferences), the two checkboxes will be unchecked by default.\r\n\r\nEverything from the original native version *should* be present in this one. If not, then that's a bug. Please report it.\r\n\r\n# Other changes since 0.10.4\r\n\r\n1. You no longer need to run any native executable files. It's a web app now, so just go to that URL.\r\n   - If you want to self-host it, it's all static files - this release should have a  \"dist.zip\" asset that you can just drop into any reasonable static web server.\r\n   - You will **need** to self-host if you want it to work with an Archipelago server that doesn't use HTTPS.\r\n2. You can now launch directly to the game if you know all the magical things to type into the URL fragment. This is mostly provided so you can refresh the page without having to click through the menu again.\r\n3. As is web tradition, most errors that happen when the game is running will not automatically take you out of the game screen. Instead, they will just create banners along the top that you have to click to dismiss. Hopefully, this will never happen to you (of course, it happened to me constantly while developing this).\r\n4. Not only is this a web app (and so it finally runs on Mac and Android), but it's a **progressive** web app. This means that you can \"install\" it as a native app on Android, even.\r\n5. Interval between \"when STILL blocked\" messages is now configurable (though it's still got a minimum of 15 minutes so that you don't spam everyone).\r\n6. There's now a separate \"Connecting...\" screen between the settings page and the main game screen, instead of showing a version of the game screen instantly and then modifying it once you're finally connected.\r\n7.

The \"u win.\" screen now just covers a *part* of the map instead of taking you all the way out.\r\n19. Fix an oversight where the self-host bundle was still expecting to run on `https://autopelago.app`\r\n20. Add a discriminator to the beginning of the title for the benefit of those with multiple tabs\r\n21. #129: Bring back the ability to show the path to the target by clicking on the rat.\r\n22. Fix a minor issue where the rat would face its ultimate target instead of the next location along the route to it.\r\n23. Fix an issue where the rat would go to the nearest user-requested location instead of going in order of when they were requested.\r\n24. (After the failed v0.11.2) probably fix a calculation error in the \"show path\" calculation?\r\n25. #130: Bring back the ability to personalize your rat.\r\n26. Replace Pixi.js with native elements, which should unblock those getting the error \"`CanvasRenderer` is not yet implemented\". This also probably brings with it a mixed bag of performance penalties and performance improvements.\r\n27. Fix several ways in which the page could look self-inconsistent while the rat is still catching up to where the server is.\r\n28. Correcte the size of the \"Personalize Your Rat!\" button on the main page for non-Firefox browsers.\r\n29. Remove a brief flicker of the \"Personalize Your Rat!\" window's header text. It might still sometimes shift, but generally shouldn't have any frames where the text goes outside the window like it did.\r\n30. Add tooltips for the filler squares to show their names, exactly the same as tooltips for landmarks.\r\n31. Add information about known hints onto these tooltips.\r\n32. Move some quest markers out of the way so that they no longer overlap filler squares.\r\n33. Shrink landmark images so that they don't crowd their filler squares.\r\n34. Extra-shrink the hitboxes around the quest markers to make their nearby filler squares easier to get to.\r\n35. Add the ability to \"hyper-focus\" a location by clicking on it (or pressing Enter on it if you are tabbing through with your keyboard). This \"hyper-focus\" can only be adjusted by interacting with it in the browser (no chat commands supported, by design) for multiple reasons.\r\n36. #134: Fix an issue where the rat's focused location(s) would get cleared \u2014 even if the location wasn't checked \u2014 if it happened to land on the location without any actions remaining to make an attempt at checking it.",

This lets you do the same stuff that the other icons in this panel let you do: click to hint for any rat (i.e., any item in the \"Rats\" item group) and hover over it to see a tooltip with all the hinted rat locations.\r\n3.

(#98) Fixed / worked around multiple sources of memory leaks when running the game for **many** hours.\r\n8. (#94) Allow toggling off all of the rat's communications that would go out to Archipelago chat.\r\n9. (#99) Adjust the default min/max times to 25/35 seconds, targeting a 2.5-hour run based on my calculations.\r\n10. (#91) (APWorld only) Item and location groups. Use `/item_groups` / `/location_groups` from the generic text client for details.\r\n11. The box in the top-left is much easier to hover over to get its tooltip now.\r\n\r\n## Balancing, Difficulty, and Timings\r\nThe big deal this release is what I've been calling \"rebalancing\".\r\n\r\nInternally, each location (including the filler ones) has a \"difficulty\" value that determines how \"hard\" it is for the rat to check that location. Essentially, this \"difficulty\" translates to how lucky the rat has to roll on the RNG, but that gets modified by the number of rats in its pack (the \"RAT\" number in the top left), its buffs / traps, and (new in 0.4.0) a \"mercy\" factor to make sure that the rat will eventually succeed at every check no matter how unlucky it gets.\r\n\r\nUntil 0.4.0, everything past the sewer level had its \"difficulty\" set to be just about as easy as it possibly could. That's because very early on in development, the game used to stop at the end of the sewer level anyway, and I knew that just blindly rescaling the difficulty of locations based on graph depth would possibly make it **less** realistic, not more.\r\n\r\nSo instead, I simulated thousands of rat-only multiworlds with a mix of 4, 10, and 25 rats in each one, recorded for each location how many attempts it took a rat (on average) to complete that check, adjusted things to target an appropriate-looking difficulty curve, and re-ran to confirm. After several rounds (and adding diminishing returns on the boost from the rat pack's size), I landed on something that looks about right to me:\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Number of average attempts to complete each landmark (10-rat multiworld)</summary>\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"asteroid_with_pants\": 9.333,\r\n  \"frozen_assets\": 8.832,\r\n  \"alien_vending_machine\": 8.126,\r\n  \"trapeze\": 7.538,\r\n  \"room_full_of_typewriters\": 6.455,\r\n  \"snakes_on_a_planet\": 5.085,\r\n  \"minotaur_labyrinth\": 4.5,\r\n  \"homeless_mummy\": 4.152,\r\n  \"seal_of_fortune\": 4.066,\r\n  \"secret_cache\": 3.526,\r\n  \"overweight_boulder\": 3.275,\r\n  \"broken_down_bus\": 3.183,\r\n  \"binary_tree\": 2.928,\r\n  \"rat_rap_battle\": 2.865,\r\n  \"space_opera\": 2.839,\r\n  \"stack_of_crates\": 2.829,\r\n  \"computer_ram\": 2.809,\r\n  \"copyright_mouse\": 2.753,\r\n  \"kart_races\": 2.672,\r\n  \"stalled_rocket_get_out_and_push\": 2.672,\r\n  \"captured_goldfish\": 2.633,\r\n  \"blue_colored_screen_interface\": 2.61,\r\n  \"daring_adventurer\": 2.53,\r\n  \"roboclop_the_robot_war_horse\": 2.45,\r\n  \"computer_interface\": 2.412,\r\n  \"bowling_ball_door\": 2.37,\r\n  \"restaurant\": 2.238,\r\n  \"pirate_bake_sale\": 2.226,\r\n  \"makeshift_rocket_ship\": 2.212,\r\n  \"angry_turtles\": 2.207,\r\n  \"basketball\": 1.984,\r\n  \"prawn_stars\": 1.934\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's hard to get **PRECISELY** what I was looking for because for some locations, the smallest possible change in difficulty will put it **MUCH** further away in the other direction. But this is still overall what I was aiming for:\r\n\r\n1. Overall and in general, later checks in a zone are \"harder\" than the earlier checks in the same zone.\r\n2. The \"hardest\" checks by far are what we've been calling the \"optional bosses\": things at the end of dead-end paths that never directly block progression towards the moon, but that could hypothetically contain something important nonetheless. A future version may make these by default more likely to contain important items (and I think this is a YAML setting you can do even in this version).\r\n3. Overweight Boulder and Broken-Down Bus are **slightly** \"harder\" than their position suggests that they \"should\" be, to simulate an element of running into a \"wall\" at an important spot in your game.\r\n4. The \"zone bosses\" (Captured Goldfish, Secret Cache, Snakes on a Planet) are the \"hardest\" required checks in their respective zones, and for the two that don't immediately lead to completion, the game actually gets a little bit \"easier\" for a while before the overall difficulty ramps back up to the same level.\r\n5. Space Opera itself is intentionally much \"easier\" than others around it: the hard part there is gathering enough rats to be able to even try it in the first place, and then all the rats also give you the biggest boost.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nHere are the step timings that would make an average game take 1 hour in my testing (so if I were targeting a 2.5-hour game, I would multiply these numbers by 2.5 to get the average and then set the min/max lower/higher to make it more random):\r\n|Rat Games in the Multiworld|Seconds per Step|\r\n|-|-|\r\n|2|8.4s per hour of game duration|\r\n|4|8.5s per hour of game duration|\r\n|10|9.3s per hour of game duration|\r\n|25|10.5s per hour of game duration|\r\n\r\nYour mileage will **absolutely** vary based on the number and type of other games present in the multiworld, but this should get you into the ballpark.",

Using a 0.7.* game client requires a multiworld generated using a 0.7.* `apworld`.\r\n\r\nThe 0.7.3 client **CAN** be used for a multiworld generated for any earlier 0.7.* version. The `.apworld` file has not changed since 0.7.0 and is provided here just for convenience.\r\n\r\n## Special Note for Existing 0.7.* Multiworlds\r\n\r\nTo those who have a multiworld in progress with Autopelago 0.7.*, please consider the following:\r\n- If the multiworld has multiple Autopelago slots, **all are encouraged to update to 0.7.3**, at their earliest convenience. Once, immediately after the upgrade, the rats will all return to the beginning with no auras, and they will have forgotten about what to prioritize. After this speedbump, they should all proceed as normal.\r\n- If the multiworld has only one Autopelago slot, then you are fine to finish it off with whichever version you started with. You **could** switch to 0.7.3 if you really want to, but you will encounter the same speedbump that I described in the other bullet point in order to fix a problem that doesn't exist, so it's your call.\r\n\r\n# Changes since 0.7.0\r\n1. ~~Possibly fixed a crash that could be triggered by as-yet-unknown circumstances.~~ Superseded by 0.7.3.\r\n2. Handle multiworlds where one or more of the games gives multiple different names to a single item or location.\r\n3. Trying to run a 0.7.* client on a 0.6.0 multiworld would go back to giving an obscure error instead of the more friendly error that was added a little while back.\r\n4. Per-game state is again stored using a key that's unique to the specific slot. Previously, it had erroneously been changed to just one constant value for all Autopelago games in the multiworld, causing them to overwrite one another.\r\n5. The per-game state wasn't getting re-saved as often as it should have. It used to only happen when the rat received an item.\r\n\r\n# Other changes since 0.6.0\r\n1. I've got a grown-up code signing certificate for grown-ups now, so Windows Defender might stop trying so hard to defend you from this. Unproven: you may still run into some stuff (especially from Windows SmartScreen).\r\n6. #108: Upon reconnecting, the rat will now immediately return to where it previously was.\r\n7. #109: If we fail to read your last settings from the `lastSettings.json` file, then we'll actually log the error (unless the \"error\" is that this is your first time running the application).\r\n8. #52: New YAML option to choose to generate only a subset of the game that stops at either the Secret Cache or the Captured Goldfish instead of going all the way.\r\n   - As part of this, the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird (formerly needed to get to \"Moon, The\") is no longer special.

Add some Easter egg suggestions from the community.\r\n3. Remove the \u00ae symbol from what is now just called \"Pharaoh-Not Anti-Mummy Spray\".\r\n   - If non-ASCII characters were more significant here, then I might have been more inclined to leave it alone.\r\n   - As this was literally the only non-ASCII character in all of Autopelago, it makes more sense to dump it and make things significantly smoother in the edge-cases where this gets run alongside an APworld or client that doesn't know any better.\r\n4. Responses to `@SlotName` commands are no longer suppressed by the checkbox on the settings screen.\r\n5. Slightly tweak the response to the `@SlotName go` command when the location is already being focused.\r\n6. Add a `@SlotName list` command to have the rat say which locations it will focus on (up to the first 5).\r\n7. #2, #83: You can now click an item in the side panel to directly request a `!hint` from the server.\r\n   - It pops up an OK/Cancel dialog first, so that it's harder for a stray click to burn your hint points.\r\n   - This does not bypass normal restrictions on hints: **ALL** that it does is send the `!hint` command, just like you could do yourself if you connected with the text client.\r\n8.
