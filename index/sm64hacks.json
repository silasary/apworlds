      "description": "Changelog:\r\n\r\nFixes:\r\n- Deathlink should no longer send multiple deaths if you pause the game\r\n- The star count when playing with hacks with 8 stars per level will no longer miscount and think there are 7 stars in each level (but still set the 8th star flag anyways)\r\n- When reconnecting to a new slot using a different hack, it no longer still thinks that you are still playing the first hack\r\n- Nonprogressive items (potentially cannons, keys, caps, or badges) are useful, instead of useless\r\n- Stars past the highest required star count for the hack are useful instead of progressive\r\n\r\nQOL:\r\n- There is an option in the JSON generator to make a star act-specific, and if it is act specific it will require all the previous stars to be possible in order to get it\r\n- JSONs now have their own progressive key option, which is a preferred default, though users can still change it if they prefer a different option\r\n- The Progressive Key yaml option has 2 new settings, `json`, which used the previously-mentioned default in the JSON, and `reversed`, where you get key 2 before key 1\r\n- The APWorld now comes bundled in with the JSON repository. It will automatically search for JSONs either bundled in with the apworld, or in the new sm64hack_jsons folder (with priority to the sm64hack_jsons folder). You can organize subfolders in the sm64hack_jsons folder and it will accept it, as long as there isn't duplicate file names\r\n\r\nNew Features:\r\n- Star Revenge 3.5 Black Switch support. It's only required for 1 check and only adds 1 extra check but it uses the same code as the SR6.25 Yellow Switch so why not\r\n- Star Revenge 6.25 full support!!! 214 normal stars, 2 cannon stars, 2 keys, 4 cap switches, and 1 Troll Star (!) make this biggest and most expansive romhack to be supported by this apworld!\r\n- Troll Stars are now (optionally) able to be shuffled! Each level with a troll star will have 1 check for collecting any troll star in the level. But beware... new items need to be created to fill the new checks created by the troll stars...\r\n- Traps! 4 new traps are included in this version of the apworld! Don't want to spoil them all, but 3 are based on community suggestions, and 1 is an idea I had when making one of the others. By default, every troll star will be replaced by a trap (this is the recommended option, as I feel it is fitting), but if you really don't like traps, you can instead replace them with singular coins. And don't worry about submitting to an async, logging on, and getting bombarded with 10 traps all at once in castle grounds; there's a special feature where if you receive a trap while you're offline, each trap will randomly pop in while you're playing, with an average time of 5 minutes per stored trap.",

      "description": "# Major Changes\r\nRemoved the bundled json files from the APWorld. Instead, every time you generate a game it will automatically download the latest JSON files from the github page, if your APWorld version is up to date enough to support the json file. The sm64hack_jsons folder now has 2 subfolders, downloaded_jsons (where the aformentioned downloaded jsons go), and custom_jsons, which is where you should now be placing your custom jsons. \r\n\r\nThis should mean that you don't have to keep downloading new versions of the APWorld just for json updates, and I don't need to go through rebuilding the APWorld just to update 1 json.\r\n\r\nIf you have any custom jsons in the sm64hack_jsons folder from the previous release, you do not need to manually move them over to the custom_jsons folder, they will be moved automatically during your first generation. These will still override the jsons in downloaded_jsons\r\n\r\nAnd if you do not want to enable automatic updates, there is an option in host.yaml to disable it.\r\n\r\n# Minor Changes\r\n- Uses user_path instead of home_path for the json folder. Should only matter if you're running the .tar.gz version of Archipelago\r\n- Castle Moat location/item should no longer be created if you are playing Star Revenge 3.5 or Star Revenge 6.25\r\n- Removed debug print statement for badges that I kept on forgetting to remove for like 5 updates now\r\n- Added manifest file since I need to do that now\r\n\r\n# JSON updates since last release\r\n## Kaizo\r\n- Updated Night of Doom json (c6 actually requires metal cap now)\r\n## Major\r\n- Mystic Purple Stars updated (idk whats actually different)\r\n- Added Super Joan Bros. 64 3\r\n## Special\r\n- Various updates to Star Revenge 3.5",
