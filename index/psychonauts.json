Install Psychonauts for PC, Astralathe, and the Psychonauts Randomizer Mod from the AP Companion Branch.\r\n    Full Psychonauts Randomizer and Astralathe setup guide here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cI3M07nWfDuBkv2M2c4NtCHPyq9koH4f2p53fgCQS4E/edit?usp=sharing\r\n    **Make sure Astralathe is up to date, use the AP Companion Branch of PsychoRando, and make sure to open the game with AstralatheLauncher.exe at least once.**\r\n    \r\n2. Download the psychonauts.apworld\r\n- For Archipelago v0.5.0 onwards, you can install the apworld by either double clicking the file, running Archipelago Launcher and dragging the file onto the window, or by placing the file inside the `custom_worlds` folder. **If you've downloaded and installed the psychonauts.apworld before Archipelago v0.5.0, make sure to delete the old apworld from the Archipelago/lib/worlds folder.**\r\n- For Archipelago v0.4.6, place the apworld inside your Archipelago/lib/worlds folder\r\n\r\n3. Open the Archipelago Launcher and run the Psychonauts Client. If you get an error message saying the root_directory could not be found, follow steps 4-5. Otherwise, skip to step 6.\r\n\r\n4. Find the folder that contains your Psychonauts and Astralathe installation, and copy the folder directory. For example, the most common place for the Steam version is \"C:\\\\\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\\\\\Steam\\\\\\\\steamapps\\\\\\\\common\\\\\\\\Psychonauts\"  \r\n\r\n5. Run ArchipelagoLauncher.exe and open host.yaml from the Archipelago Launcher, find the psychonauts_options and paste your psychonauts game directory into the root_directory setting between the quotes. **If the root directory contains single slashes between lines, change all of these to double slashes. If you don't, the client will fail to open**\r\n\r\n6. Click \"Generate Template Settings\". This will open file explorer\r\nFind \"Psychonauts.yaml\" and copy it to /Players/ (create this folder if it does not exist)\r\n\r\n7. Open the YAML file and change the line that says \"name: Player{number}\" to your desired player name.\r\nAdjust the settings in the YAML to your liking\r\n\r\n8. Run ArchipelagoGenerate.exe\r\n\r\n9. Take the newly created AP_XXX.zip file in /output/ in upload it here: https://archipelago.gg/uploads\r\n\r\n10. Unzip the AP_XXX.zip file. Find the zipped file containing your player number and name, and unzip it. This contains a file called RandoSeed.lua \r\n\r\n11. Find your Psychonauts game directory and open /ModResource/PsychoRando/Scripts\r\n\r\n12. Paste RandoSeed.lua from your generated Archipelago file into this folder. Replace the file in the destination if needed.\r\n\r\n13. Run AstralatheLauncher.exe to open the game. You should see your player number and name on the menu screen, along with your current randomizer version.\r\n\r\n14. From the menu, enter the yellow door to start a new game.\r\n\r\n15. From the Archipelago Launcher, open the Psychonauts Client and connect to your server hosted on archipelago.gg\r\n\r\n16. Once you've started a new save file and connected to the server, you can start playing!",

Setting is a maximum percentage choice, will only add locations to that percentage threshold or lower.\r\n- Progressive Baggage: Get a reward every time you redeem a Baggage Tag with it's matching Baggage. For example, redeeming your first Hatbox will give location Progressive Hatbox 1, the second will give Progressive Hatbox 2, etc.\r\n- Maximum Progressive Baggage: Sets the maximum locations per baggage type. For example, setting this to 4 will only place locations on the first 4 baggage you redeem, per baggage type.\r\n- Archipelago Item Model: Choose what your Archipelago items for other games look like inside Psychonauts. Choices include the standard Archipelago symbol (archipelago), the original meat circus bunny (classic), and a holiday gift box (present).\r\n\r\n## Major Changes\r\n- Rewards from Ranking Up are now automatically given to the player instead of being placed in Ford's Sanctuary.\r\n- Baggage will no longer be placed on Rank Up rewards.\r\n- Added AP Merit Badge custom icon for the client.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Prevent entering the loading zone for the Final Boss in Meat Circus even when the Fat Lady is present.\r\n- Paintings from Black Velvetopia will no longer appear in inventory between levels.

      "description": "# New Options\r\n- Rank Sanity: Get a reward for EVERY Rank Up, instead of every five ranks.\r\n- Figment Percentage Checks: Get a reward for every 20% of figments found per level. Setting is a maximum percentage choice, will only add locations to that percentage threshold or lower.\r\n- Hint Unclaimed Baggage: When interacting with Baggage that you don't have a matching tag for yet, automatically creates a hint for the location in the client.\r\n- Progressive Baggage: Get a check instead of a Rank Up every time you redeem a Baggage Tag with it's matching Baggage. For example, redeeming your first Hatbox will give location Progressive Hatbox 1, the second will give Progressive Hatbox 2, etc.\r\n- Maximum Progressive Baggage: Sets the maximum locations per baggage type. For example, setting this to 4 will only place locations on the first 4 baggage you redeem, per baggage type.\r\n- Archipelago Item Model: Choose what your Archipelago items for other games look like inside Psychonauts. Choices include the standard Archipelago symbol (archipelago), the original meat circus bunny (classic), and a holiday gift box (present).\r\n- Vault Hints: Memory Vaults will hint a random uncollected location inside your world.\r\n- Vault Count: Adjust the total number of vaults in your item pool. Range of 0 to 101.\r\n\r\n## Major Changes\r\n- Rewards from Ranking Up are now automatically given to the player instead of being placed in Ford's Sanctuary.\r\n- Baggage will no longer be placed on Rank Up rewards.\r\n- start_inventory now uses StartInventoryPool, meaning any items added to starting inventory will be removed from your item pool when placing items into Psychonauts during generation. Prevents duplicate mind unlocks, extra progressive powers, etc. \r\n- Crow Feather and Watering Can join the junk item pool\r\n- Removed Lootbox Vault Option\r\n- Vaults no longer give a Rank Up as a reward, Arrowhead reward now 25\r\n- Using the Bacon now has a dialogue option with your Archipelago Goal\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Prevent entering the loading zone for the Final Boss in Meat Circus even when the Fat Lady is present.\r\n- Paintings from Black Velvetopia will no longer appear in inventory between levels. Entering Gloria's Theater with the paintings in your inventory would cause the game to crash.\r\n- Fixed Figment Percentage logic for 100% Figments in WW and BV\r\n- Softlocks in LO and BV prevented. After entering the Boss arena, leaving and returning to the level will place you in the previous sub-level instead\r\n\r\n# Resources\r\nSetup Guide with installation instructions and additional information for PsychoRando Archipelago here:\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1b7QOnOLmTSvdC7A1YK3bsSmhtSOsAMs0XF5j-tyE6Zw/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nRequires Astralathe to run, download and installation instructions found here:\r\nhttps://gitlab.com/scrunguscrungus/astralathe/-/wikis/Installing%20Astralathe\r\n\r\nRequires Archipelago to run, download and installation instructions found here:\r\nhttps://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases\r\n\r\nPsychonauts Archipelago AP World Here:\r\nhttps://github.com/Akashortstack/Psychonauts-AP-Integration/releases",

Download the psychonauts.apworld and install (easiest method is by trying to open the apworld file, Archipelago will install automatically)\r\n\r\n3. Open the Archipelago Launcher and run the Psychonauts Client. If you get an error message saying the root_directory could not be found, follow steps 4-5. Otherwise, skip to step 6.\r\n\r\n4. Find the folder that contains your Psychonauts and Astralathe installation, and copy the folder directory. For example, the most common place for the Steam version is \"C:\\\\\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\\\\\Steam\\\\\\\\steamapps\\\\\\\\common\\\\\\\\Psychonauts\"  \r\n\r\n5. Run ArchipelagoLauncher.exe and open host.yaml from the Archipelago Launcher, find the psychonauts_options and paste your psychonauts game directory into the root_directory setting between the quotes. **If the root directory contains single slashes between lines, change all of these to double slashes. If you don't, the client will fail to open**\r\n\r\n6. Click \"Generate Template Settings\". This will open file explorer\r\nFind \"Psychonauts.yaml\" and copy it to /Players/ (create this folder if it does not exist)\r\n\r\n7. Open the YAML file and change the line that says \"name: Player{number}\" to your desired player name.\r\nAdjust the settings in the YAML to your liking\r\n\r\n8. Run ArchipelagoGenerate.exe\r\n\r\n9. Take the newly created AP_XXX.zip file in /output/ in upload it here: https://archipelago.gg/uploads then create a room\r\n\r\n10. Download patch file next to your player name, then unzip the file. This contains a file called RandoSeed.lua \r\n\r\n11. Find your Psychonauts game directory and open /ModResource/PsychoRando/Scripts\r\n\r\n12. Paste RandoSeed.lua from your generated Archipelago file into this folder. Replace the file in the destination if needed.\r\n\r\n13. Run AstralatheLauncher.exe to open the game. You should see your player number and name on the menu screen, along with your current randomizer version.\r\n\r\n14. From the menu, enter the yellow door to start a new game.\r\n\r\n15.
