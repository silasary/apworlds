      "description": "The Zero Mission apworld is now ready to play. Here's a brief overview:\r\n\r\n## Goal\r\nCurrently, you only need to defeat Mecha Ridley. Other goals will be added later, but for now we encourage you to defeat Mother Brain first.\r\n\r\n## Options\r\nSome of the more important ones are:\r\n- Chozodia Access: If set to closed, the power bomb doors in Crateria will be locked until Mother Brain is defeated\r\n- Unknown Items Always Usable: On by default. Allows you to use the Plasma Beam, Space Jump, and Gravity Suit as soon as you obtain them.\r\n- Layout Patches: Modifies the following rooms to reduce softlocks:\r\n  - Hallway to Long Beam: The three beam blocks never reform, so you don't need long beam, missiles, or bombs to leave.\r\n  - Norfair elevator from Brinstar: The elevator goes to the bottom of the room so you don't need items or wall jumps to leave.\r\n  - Crateria Morph Ball tunnel to Plasma Beam: Adds beam blocks so you can escape if you go in without Hi-Jump or Bombs.\r\n  - Crateria waterway between gunship and Norfair elevator: Changes Speed Booster blocks to beam blocks so you can always get back to Norfair.\r\n  - Kraid escape shaft: Changes some Speed Booster blocks to beam blocks so you can get back up.\r\n- Logic options: Whether to consider consider wall jumps, infinite bomb jumps, heat runs, and lava dives in logic.\r\n\r\n## Differences from vanilla\r\n- Deorem will attack you if you have Super Missiles but not Missiles.\r\n- Power Bombs are usable without having regular Bombs.\r\n- The Gravity Suit does not give heat resistance, and the Varia Suit is not given to you for completing the ruins test in Chozodia. (Currently the ruins test does forcibly equip Gravity Suit, to be fixed in a later release)\r\n- You can toggle items on the Samus screen by pressing Select.\r\n- You can warp to your starting location in Brinstar by holding L and R while selecting No when asked to save at a save station or the gunship.\r\n- The invincible geron in Norfair that blocks you without Power Grip is removed.\r\n- Chozo Statue hints are disabled for now, so they all start seated to not block your way\r\n- The in-game timer counts a second as 60 frames instead of 64. The escape timer currently does not have this fix.",

      "description": "This one sure took a while. We got a little scope-crept, I think. In any case, it's here now.\r\n\r\nThe *main* focus of this update was to iterate on some of the original systems from the first release to make them more consistent and stable. Logic rules and item patching have been greatly improved with far fewer issues. The client has also been updated to make the AP experience nicer and more tolerant of something going wrong with the server.\r\n\r\nSome of these patch notes may seem familiar to you, and that's because 0.1.3 accidentally was built from the dev branch for this update. I never got around to correcting that release since that version seemed pretty stable.\r\n\r\n## Additions\r\n- Item sprite support for Metroid Prime and Super Metroid Map Rando.\r\n  - Added custom sprites for all Super Metroid items and some Metroid Prime items.\r\n\r\n### Options\r\n- Goal\r\n  - Mecha Ridley: The door to Mecha Ridley is always accessible\r\n  - Major Bosses: The door to Mecha Ridley is locked until Kraid, Ridley, Mother Brain, and the Chozo Ghost are defeated.\r\n- Start with Maps: Start the game with all map stations visited.\r\n- Logic Difficulty\r\n  - When enabled, logic can expect you to perform more niche techniques or perform combat with more limited resources.\r\n  - A few examples of these tricks are entering hidden tunnels, jump extends, and Acid Worm skip.\r\n- Tricky Shinesparks\r\n  - When enabled, logic can expect more difficult or unintuitive Shinesparks for traversal.\r\n  - Examples include collecting Brinstar Ceiling E-Tank with a spark and accessing the Norfair larva room without Wave Beam.\r\n  - Locations such as Chozodia Chozo Ghost Area Long Shinespark and Crateria Landing Site Ballspark that require difficult shinesparks normally are not affected by this option.\r\n- Layout Patches\r\n  - Ridley ball cannon room: allows escape from the bottom without needing to use the ball cannon\r\n  - Crateria landing site access from Power Grip tower: widens the gap between the pillar and ceiling so it can be hi- or wall-jumped into.\r\n- Fast Item Banners: The messages displayed when getting an item can be closed faster and never open the equipment screen.\r\n- Remote Items\r\n  - Receive items from your own world, allowing co-op play.\r\n  - If you game-over or reset, the items lost in the save reload will be returned to you.\r\n  - Even with this option enabled, you can still play offline, but your items will not be given back.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Overhauled the way items are handled by both the game and the client. This fixes a lot of jank in the original implementation.\r\n- Overhauled logic definitions using a new system. Many of the rules themselves have also been changed.\r\n- Changed the names of many locations\r\n- IBJ In Logic option\r\n  - True and False replaced with None, Vertical Only, and Horizontal And Vertical\r\n- Client changes:\r\n  - Can now sync your items to the server state, regardless of the new Remote Items option\r\n  - When you game-over or reset, remote items that have already been sent to you once will not show a message again\r\n  - Items sent from your own slot (e.g. by !getitem cheat) no longer show your own name\r\n  - When receiving multiple items at once, tanks will be grouped together and added to your capacity in bulk.\r\n- The patcher will now fail if the client won't be able to read the patched ROM.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n- Fixed strange death link behavior.\r\n- Death links can now be received from other players in the same slot.\r\n- Fixed generator failures with Unknown Items Always Usable turned off.\r\n- Fixed a bunch of other bugs that I can't remember.\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/lilDavid/Archipelago-Metroid-Zero-Mission/compare/0.1.3...0.2.0",
