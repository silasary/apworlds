The branch at https://github.com/lilDavid/Archipelago/tree/wario_land_4 will stay open but is currently not being updated while I work out how to handle the two together.\r\n\r\n## Additions\r\n- Added option groups\r\n- Actually added the Trap Behavior option. Accumulate is the previous behavior; Apply Once forces you to only receive one of each trap type if multiple get sent to you while you're not in a level\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Because of the option groups addition, this release requires Archipelago version **0.5.0** or newer\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n- Fixed the music and Wario voice shuffle options bleeding across players\r\n- Fixed a generation failure with the doors option set to open",

      "description": "This one should've been a simple bugfix but got scope-creeped. And I got occupied decompiling the vanilla game which delayed it further. Oops. (at least it ended up being useful for this)\r\n\r\n- This AP world now requires AP version 0.6.0 or newer\r\n- Renamed 40 Below Fridge snowman puzzle boxes so the names are correct on all difficulties (**this is a breaking change**)\r\n- Improved the open portals visual so the vortex never closes\r\n- Added tricks to advanced logic:\r\n  - 40 Below Fridge with heavy grab: throw the Yeti at the block during the escape\r\n  - Domino Row escape with only swim: Shoulder bash the blocks on the way up. You can take a hit and use the invulnerability frames to hit the second one through the spikes. This replaces the strategies of using grab or head smash.\r\n- Fixed golden treasure requirement being completely ignored by logic\r\n- Fixed client inappropriately sending locations for the wrong level (and made some adjustments so it's *slightly* more responsive to your game state)\r\n- Fixed boss door cutscenes sometimes playing (and the occasional freeze that resulted)\r\n- Fixed certain options overfilling the item pool\r\n- Fixed Monsoon Jungle fat plummet room access rules\r\n- Fixed Toy Block Tower digging room diamond access rule\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/lilDavid/Archipelago-Wario-Land-4/compare/3.1.1...3.2.0\r\n**Basepatch Changelog**: https://github.com/lilDavid/WL4-Archipelago-Patch/compare/ab3336b...e73b5b2",
