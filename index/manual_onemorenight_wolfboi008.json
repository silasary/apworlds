Since the items are not actually withheld from the player,\nthe player must manually refrain from using these gathered items until the tracker shows that they have been acquired or sent.",

This was the compromise I decided on.\r\n- **Added all of Severed Connections' new content.**\r\n- Removed FMNoob. A salute and moment of silence to an old friend.\r\n- Removed some of the Sandbox Challenges since they aren't in this update.\r\n- Renamed `Music Box` to `Handheld Music Box`.\r\n- Added the `Handheld Music Box` as a condition for Puppet-related logic.\r\n- Added an Option that allows you to remove all of the Flashlight Skins from the pool.\r\n- Added a couple of miscellaneous Filler Items.\r\n- Adjusted the wording of some YAML text in a few places.\r\n- One new set of Checks added in this update was originally just an Option. However, it was merged to be a part of the main gameplay due to its logical simplicity.\r\n  - This finally fixes https://github.com/WolfBoi008/One-More-Night/issues/18, now with no intentional failures necessary!\r\n- Added an Option called Bell Logic, which allows the Player to decide if the Pocket Bell is considered for logic in some places or if it's ignored.\r\n- Other things that I may have forgotten (or wrote in other pre-releases but didn't feel like needed to be mentioned here).\r\n\r\nIf there's anything I messed up logically or missed, feel free to let me know or [post an Issue](https://github.com/WolfBoi008/One-More-Night/issues)!
