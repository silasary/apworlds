      "description": "-Added Final Marluxia logic\r\n-Castle Oblivion now opens when you have all 7 friend cards\r\n\r\n----------\r\n### How to play (GBA COM):\r\n\r\nNote: This randomizer only supports the US version of Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories for GBA\r\n\r\n1. Download the khcom.apworld file and connector_khcom.lua script\r\n2. Place your khcom.apworld file in your worlds folder (usually /lib/worlds/)\r\n3. Place your connector_khcom.lua script in your lua folder (usually /data/lua/)\r\n4. Run ArchipelagoLauncher.exe\r\n5. Click \"Generate Template Settings\".  This will open file explorer\r\n6. Find \"Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories.yaml\" and copy it to /Players/ (create this folder if it does not exist)\r\n7. Open the YAML file and change the line that says \"name: Player{number}\" to your desired player name.\r\n8. Adjust the settings in the YAML to your liking\r\n9. Run ArchipelagoGenerate.exe\r\n10. Take the newly created AP_XXX.zip file in /output/ in upload it here: https://archipelago.gg/uploads/\r\n11. Open ArchipelagoLauncher.exe\r\n12. Click \"KHCOM Client\" and connect to your server hosted on archipelago.gg\r\n13. Open Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories in BizHawk\r\n14. On the title screen, navigate to Tools > LUA Console\r\n15. In the LUA Console window, navigate to Script > Open Script\r\n16. Open /data/lua/connector_khcom.lua\r\n17. Confirm the script is running by verifying the script is listed in your active scripts and a green triangle appears before the script name\r\n18. Play!\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n### How the randomizer works:\r\n\r\n-  You begin the game as normal in Traverse Town on Floor 1.\r\n- You start with a Key of Beginnings, Key of Guidance, and Key to Truth for Floor 1, as well as infinite (non-gold) map cards of each type and value.\r\n- Collecting battle cards in the overworld WILL NOT ADD THEM TO YOUR INVENTORY.\r\n- Story and card journal entries are checks\r\n- You are allowed to warp to any floor at the start.\r\n- Floors which you don't have unlocked are simply assigned Traverse Town.\r\n- If card packs are on, some locations hold card packs, which are the only way to obtain battle cards. These card packs come in three varieties: bronze, silver, and gold\r\n- If card sets are on, some locations locations hold sets of specific cards (Kingdom Key 4-6 for example).  These are the only way to obtain battle cards.\r\n- Friend cards (Aladdin, Ariel, Beast, Donald, Goofy, Jack, Peter Pan) are randomly placed at checks. \r\n- In GBA COM, when you have found all 7 friend cards, F13 is opened.  Defeat Final Marluxia and receive the Victory item to win.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n### Card Packs:\r\n### Bronze\r\n- Most abundant\r\n- Contains 3 cards of any numeric value of the following types: Kingdom Key, Three Wishes, Pumpkinhead, Olympia, Wishing Star, Lady Luck, Potion, Hi-Potion, Ether, Fire, Blizzard, Thunder, Simba, Genie, Cloud, Dumbo\r\n\r\n### Silver\r\n- Second most abundant\r\n- Contains 3 cards of any numeric value of the following types: Lionheart, Metal Chocobo, Spellbinder, Divine Rose, Crabclaw, Mega-Potion, Elixir, Mega-Ether, Cure, Stop, Gravity, Aero, Bambi, Mushu, Tinker Bell\r\n\r\n### Gold\r\n- Least abundant\r\n- Contains 3 cards of any numeric value of the following types: Oathkeeper, Oblivion, Diamond Dust, One-Winged Angel, Ultima Weapon, Megalixir",

Play!\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n### How the randomizer works:\r\n\r\n-  You begin the game as normal in Traverse Town on Floor 1.\r\n- You start with a Key of Beginnings, Key of Guidance, and Key to Truth for Floor 1, as well as infinite (non-gold) map cards of each type and value.\r\n- Collecting battle cards in the overworld WILL NOT ADD THEM TO YOUR INVENTORY.\r\n- Story and card journal entries are checks\r\n- You are allowed to warp to any floor at the start.\r\n- Floors which you don't have unlocked are simply assigned Traverse Town.\r\n- If card packs are on, some locations hold card packs, which are the only way to obtain battle cards. These card packs come in three varieties: bronze, silver, and gold\r\n- If card sets are on, some locations locations hold sets of specific cards (Kingdom Key 4-6 for example).  These are the only way to obtain battle cards.\r\n- Friend cards (Aladdin, Ariel, Beast, Donald, Goofy, Jack, Peter Pan) are randomly placed at checks. \r\n- In GBA COM, when you have found all 7 friend cards, F13 is opened.  Defeat Final Marluxia and receive the Victory item to win.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n### Card Packs:\r\n### Bronze\r\n- Most abundant\r\n- Contains 3 cards of any numeric value of the following types: Kingdom Key, Three Wishes, Pumpkinhead, Olympia, Wishing Star, Lady Luck, Potion, Hi-Potion, Ether, Fire, Blizzard, Thunder, Simba, Genie, Cloud, Dumbo\r\n\r\n### Silver\r\n- Second most abundant\r\n- Contains 3 cards of any numeric value of the following types: Lionheart, Metal Chocobo, Spellbinder, Divine Rose, Crabclaw, Mega-Potion, Elixir, Mega-Ether, Cure, Stop, Gravity, Aero, Bambi, Mushu, Tinker Bell\r\n\r\n### Gold\r\n- Least abundant\r\n- Contains 3 cards of any numeric value of the following types: Oathkeeper, Oblivion, Diamond Dust, One-Winged Angel, Ultima Weapon, Megalixir",
