Thank you to @fuegobillyb for their report on this. The full list of locations changed to fix typos/inconsistencies can be found in this issue: https://github.com/benny-dreamly/Sims4ArchipelagoMod/issues/7\r\n\r\n# Changes\r\n\r\n- Some location names have been changed. See above comment for more details on this change.\r\n- Item and Location Groups have been added! Thank you to everyone who suggested this throughout the course of our first beta async in the archipelago server! \r\n- Universal Tracker support has also been added!\r\n  - A tab in the Client has been added to facilitate using the tracker if installed.\r\n  - For seeds generated from now on, a yaml is no longer required to use the tracker. However, you can still provide your yaml to the tracker if you would like. \r\n- Various code changes behind the scenes have made the apworld easier to work on, and it now adheres better to AP code standards.\r\n\r\n# Fixes\r\n\r\n- Logic issues discovered during our first beta async have been fixed! Thank you to everyone who participated in testing the apworld. Your help was very appreciated to fix these issues! \r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/benny-dreamly/Archipelago/compare/sims-1.5.2...sims-1.6.0",
