      "description": "Initial release of the Plants vs. Zombies Replanted Archipelago implementation.\r\n\r\nDefend your lawn against hordes of undead in this Archipelago implementation of Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted!\r\n\r\n- Find items by clearing levels, defeating Huge Waves or purchasing them from Crazy Dave.\r\n- Items consist of plants and the game's various other unlocks (Shovel, Pool Cleaners, Roof Cleaners, Moustache Mode, etc.)\r\n- Optionally lock Adventure Mode areas behind different access items: Night Access, Pool Access, Fog Access and Roof Access. After unlocking different areas, you can jump back and forth between them in whatever order you'd like.\r\n- Choose which extra modes are included within the game. Mini-games, Puzzle, Survival, Cloudy Day and Bonus Levels (aka Limbo Page) are all supported.\r\n- Optionally randomise the order of level unlocks within Mini-games, Puzzle and Survival modes.\r\n- Traps: \"Mower Deploy Trap\", \"Seed Packet Cooldown Trap\" and \"Zombie Ambush Trap\".\r\n- Randomise the music played during gameplay by level or by type.\r\n- Complete your seed by defeating Dr. Zomboss at the end of Adventure Mode!\r\n\r\nFor instructions, see the [Setup Guide.](https://github.com/dannybonz/replanted_archipelago/blob/main/apworld/docs/setup.md)",

For example, Twin Sunflower can be placed directly onto the lawn without needing Sunflower. The Sun costs for these plants are also increased accordingly - no spamming 200 Sun Winter Melons!\r\n- Adds in-game clear indicators to levels within Adventure Mode, Cloudy Day and Bonus Levels.\r\n- Fixed an issue that would occur when playing Slot Machine with fewer than three plants unlocked.\r\n- Fixed an issue causing Dr. Zomboss to sometimes not become available when he should.\r\n- The level selector screen now more accurately remembers your most recently played level and focuses on it automatically when entering.

      "description": "- **Adds Conveyor Belt randomisation!** If enabled, this randomises the plants present on each Conveyor Belt level in the game across Adventure Mode, Mini-games and Bonus Levels. This is compatible with any combination of Zombie randomisation and Plant Stat randomisation.\r\n- **Expands Zombie randomisation into other modes!** You can now randomise Zombies across Adventure Mode, Mini-games, Survival Mode, Cloudy Day and Bonus Levels! You are able to select which modes will be affected with the `zombie_randomised_modes` option.\r\n- **Adds a `china_level` option, allowing you to incorporate the China level (\"The Great Wall\") into your run.** If enabled, the China level will count towards the \"Total Levels\" goal. As such, the \"Total Levels\" goal can now be set to 120 instead of 119!\r\n- Adds `starting_sun_upgrades` and `maximum_sun_upgrade` options, allowing you to add \"Additional Starting Sun\" items to your game. These increase the amount of Sun that you will start a level with. You can choose for each upgrade to add 5 Sun, 25 Sun or 50 Sun each, to a maximum of 50-150 total additional Sun.\r\n- Slightly buffed Trash Can Zombie. His speed now varies slightly based on his position, with him being faster at first then slowing down to slightly above his normal speed.\r\n- You can now see randomised Plant stats during gameplay by hovering over a Seed Packet with your cusor or controller.\r\n- Fixed an issue where controller users could not see randomised Plant stats during the \"Choose Your Seeds\" screen.\r\n- Fixed an issue where randomised Plant stats would sometimes apply in places they aren't supposed to.\r\n- Slight tweaks to the generation of randomised Plant stats.\r\n\r\nFor instructions, see the [Setup Guide.](https://github.com/dannybonz/replanted_archipelago/blob/main/apworld/docs/setup.md)",

      "description": "- If Bungee Zombie appears in Bobsled Bonanza, Pogo Party or Air Raid, then Umbrella Leaf will be logically expected before the level can be cleared.\r\n- Giga Gargantuar can no longer appear in Bobsled Bonanza, Pogo Party or Air Raid.\r\n- Zomboni can no longer appear in Roof: Level 5-5.\r\n- Conveyor randomisation will no longer allow Spikeweed and Spikerock on Roof levels.\r\n- Corrected the Sun cost of Spikerock when playing with `easy_upgrade_plants` enabled.\r\n- Fixed a logic issue that could result in the game expecting you to beat Night levels without Sun producing plants. \r\n- Fixed the potential for `plant_stat_randomisation` to roll negative Sun costs.\r\n\r\nThis update only affects the APWorld.
