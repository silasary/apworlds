This one fixes some recent bugs, including ones with Enemy Kills.\r\n\r\n**In this release:**\r\n\r\n- Logic fixes for Enemy Kills enemies, specifically around RPD 2 enemies\r\n- Removed the Maiden Statue licker and hanging zombie in Sewers from Enemy Kills, as they spawn/die inconsistently\r\n- If both Enemy Kills and Weapon Rando are on, and no fire weapons are rolled, Ivys become excluded/filler locations\r\n- When Allow Prog. in Labs is on, Sewers Key is statically placed at the vanilla T-Bar location in Sewers now \r\n  - This is to prevent having to backtrack to Sewers after leaving for Labs\r\n\r\nThat's it for this one.
