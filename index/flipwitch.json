      "description": "Screw 0.3.0 or whatever the number system is dumb anyway.\r\n\r\nI'll likely put this as a release soon.\r\n\r\n# Beta\r\nThis is a beta.  Not every feature I want (mainly internal settings) is in.  Logic might be bad or wrong.  The game itself might have bugs.  I'm releasing this as its \"playable enough\" IMO for more specific test case situations to come up.\r\n\r\n# New Features\r\n- Starting Area Rando\r\n  - You start one of the many crystal teleport spots in the game.  Some are excluded due to either triviality, or having zero sphere 1 checks.\r\n- Shuffle Double Jump\r\n  - You cannot double jump.  Logic for a double jump requires either the new item, or Angel Feathers.\r\n- Shuffle Dodge\r\n  - You cannot dodge.  Logic for dodging requires the item.  Ghost form gets to dodge to get through vines.\r\n- Pottery Lottery\r\n  - yay the location spam setting is here /monotone.  More seriously, pots drop items.  Do you remember them all?  Did I?\r\n- Crystal Teleports\r\n  - Checking a teleport panel gives you an item.  The ability to warp to one is an item.\r\n- Universal Tracker\r\n  - UT should work right now.  There's no poptracker support for it atm.\r\n  - I literally just wrote this so there could be bugs.\r\n- New Items!\r\n  - Rose Ribbon: Allows you to double jump.\r\n  - Orb of Avoidance: Allows you to dodge.\r\n\r\n# Changes\r\n- Massive logic overhaul, due to the above causing it.\r\n- Updated whatever sprites Kaito has put together to something more recent.\r\n\r\n# Bugfixes on this while I've been away (idk not very exhaustive)\r\n- Fixed some logic problems with Behind the Vines and Dirty Debut\r\n- Added Demon Wings as a means of \"Ghost Dodging\" (You need to be able to dodge as ghost to slip past vines, and it counts).\r\n- Add Abandoned Apartment to the list of zones for sewers.",
