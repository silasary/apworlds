After generating, be sure to send your Dragon Warrior player the `.apdw` patch file so they can play.\r\n\r\n## Joining\r\nAs above, your host should send you the `.apdw` patch file. Be sure to open this using the \"Open Patch\" button in the Archipelago Launcher, simply double-clicking the file will result in an error. You will be prompted for your legally dumped `.nes` ROM of Dragon Warrior the first time, as well as your [Bizhawk Emulator](https://tasvideos.org/Bizhawk) installation. Once the client opens, be sure the URL and port at the top are accurate, hit connect, then type your player name (slot) and enjoy!\r\n",
