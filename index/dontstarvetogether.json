      "description": "An implementation of Archipelago Multiworld for Don't Starve Together. This is a beta release. It's feature-complete and playable, but has some bugs and needs some testing and cleanup.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\nMost prototyped recipes have been randomized! Instead of learning recipes at a research station, you earn them through item checks.\r\nItem checks can be found several ways:\r\n- Creature kills\r\n- Boss kills\r\n- Researching at crafting stations (science, magic, think tank, ancient, celestial)\r\n- Traded by Crabby Hermit\r\n- Cooking crock pot meals\r\n- Farming giant plants\r\n- In place of rare blueprints\r\nOptionally, you can have traps in your random item pool, including season changing traps!\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\nYou have a few options to set as your completion condition:\r\n- Survival: Survive the Constant for a set amount of time.\r\n- Bosses (any): Choose from several bosses in the game as your targets. Defeating any selected boss will complete your goal.\r\n- Bosses (all): Choose multiple bosses that all must be defeated before you claim victory!\r\n\r\n## Setup:\r\n- Install [Archipelago](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases)\r\n- Add .apworld to lib/worlds folder of your Archipelago install\r\n- Follow Archipelago's general tutorial on how to generate a game. https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en\r\n- Subscribe to the mod on the Steam Workshop (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3218471273) or download the attached mod.\r\n- Once you're all set up, open the Archipelago launcher and run the client for Don't Starve Together. You just have to leave it open.\r\n- Once you're in Don't Starve Together with the mod installed, you can connect to Archipelago in-game.\r\n",
