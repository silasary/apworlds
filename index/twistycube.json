      "description": "Surprise release, already **playable**! A complete new way to solve a Twisty Cube!\r\n### What?\r\nThe game randomizes the cube by only starting with a couple of stickers.\r\nAs you go, you'll find more stickers and you'll be able to complete your cube.\r\nOf course you can play via Archipelago, where you find items for partially solving and others find your stickers.\r\n:warning: this game might be much harder than you think, even if you know how to solve cubes. Maybe we can make some custom guides.\r\n### How?\r\nYou can play here: https://cube-ap.netlify.app/\r\nClick on one of the **solo buttons** to give it a quick try, no need to set up a server and such!\r\n**Controls**: move with the mouse. You can also use letters F, B, L, R, U, D and Shift-F, Shift-B, ... to move faces. Arrow keys (Left, Right, Up, Down) and Shift-Arrow (Shift-up, Shift-Down) to rotate the cube.\r\n### Where?\r\nThe **apworld** and default **yaml** are included in this release.\r\n### And?\r\n- The scoring is a bit weird maybe. Just have each side have one color and you'll be fine :)\r\n- In solo, no progress is saved. In Archipelago, of course your checks and items are saved, but your last configuration of the cube is not.\r\n- This game is based on the brilliant work of https://codepen.io/bsehovac/pen/EMyWVv, which allows for any changes.",
