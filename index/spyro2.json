      "description": "# Spyro 2 - Ripto's Rage (1999) - Archipelago Implementation v0.1.0\r\n\r\nThis is the initial alpha/unstable release of an APWorld and Client for Spyro 2 for PSX. This supports only NTSC-U (US release) of the original game and requires Windows and Duckstation to play.\r\n\r\nRelease: https://github.com/Uroogla/S2AP/releases/tag/0.1.0\r\nSetup and Requirements: https://github.com/Uroogla/S2AP/blob/main/README.md\r\n\r\n## What Checks are Supported?\r\n- All 14 talismans\r\n- All 64 Orbs\r\n- 25%, 50%, 75%, and/or 100% of gems in each level (optional)\r\n- Every 500 total gems, to a user specified maximum (optional)\r\n- Skill Points (optional)\r\n\r\n## What Goals are Possible?\r\n- Defeat Ripto with 40+ orbs (default)\r\n- Defeat Ripto with 14 talismans, regardless of orb count\r\n- Defeat Ripto by any means possible\r\n- Defeat Ripto with all 64 orbs\r\n- Defeat Ripto with 10000 gems, 64 orbs, and 14 talismans\r\n- Obtain all 10 Dragon Shores tokens\r\n- Obtain all 16 skill points\r\n- Complete the epilogue by defeating Ripto and obtaining all 16 skill points\r\n\r\n## What's in the Item Pool?\r\n- 6 Summer Forest Talismans (not tied to individual levels).  All 6 required to enter Crush in logic.\r\n- 8 Autumn Plains Talismans (not tied to individual levels).  All 14 talismans required to enter Gulp in logic.\r\n- 64 Orbs (not tied to individual challenges)\r\n- Moneybags Unlocks (optional)\r\n- Progressive Sparx Health Upgrades, allowing you to start with lower max HP for a challenge (optional)\r\n- Permanent Fireball Ability (optional)\r\n- Double Jump Ability (optional)\r\n- Miscellaneous Fun/Helpful Items (pick which to include)\r\n  - Extra Lives\r\n  - Sparx Heal\r\n  - Change Spyro's Color\r\n  - Big Head Mode and Flat Spyro Mode\r\n- Miscellaneous Traps (pick which to include)\r\n  - Sparx Damage Trap\r\n  - Sparxless Trap\r\n  - Temporary Invisible Spyro Trap\r\n\r\n## Known Bugs\r\n- There may be occasional missyncs between the client and server (off by 1 item issue).  Typing `clearSpyroGameState` into the client and following its instructions will generally fix this.\r\n\r\n## Are There Custom Client Commands?\r\n- `clearSpyroGameState` Resync your save file's received items with the server in case of a desync.  This may result in duplicate filler items.\r\nIf playing on a new save file, you will still need to finish Glimmer and beat Crush and Gulp to proceed.\r\n- `showTalismanCount` Prints how many Summer Forest Talisman items and how many Autumn Plains Talisman items the player has received.\r\n- `useQuietHints` Suppresses hints for found locations to make the client easier to read. On by default.\r\n- `useVerboseHints` Include found locations in hint lists. Due to Archipelago Server limitations, only applies to hints requested after this change.\r\n",

Anything breakable or defeatable will be broken/defeated when Spyro runs into it, for a short time.\r\n- Add Life Bottles as Checks\r\n- Add Partial Gemsanity, which makes 200 random gems into checks and adds 8 \"50 gem\" items for each level with loose gems in it.  This feature is in alpha, use at your own risk.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\n- Client may display an error that it could not write to DataStorage if you receive an item at the same time it is writing.  As long as this message doesn't repeat every minute, this is fine.\r\n- During Gemsanity, entering a level or respawning on death may play a beeping noise.  This is *technically* vanilla behavior.\r\n- Loading into a save during Gemsanity may release a few extra checks, based on what gems you've collected so far.\r\n- Some users have reported checks sending when connecting to the server at the loading screen or when resetting Duckstation.  To avoid this, connect to the server when in game, and close the client before resetting.",

The client will largely work with seeds in progress, though Summer Forest gem 46 may be logically required without swim, despite requiring it in practice.\r\n\r\nNew Features:\r\n- Full Gemsanity Beta\r\n  - Full Gemsanity makes every gem a check but the gem items are all local.  Full Global makes every gem a check with no restrictions on the location of gem items.\r\n  - For games with more than 1 player, these settings require host approval via the allow_full_gemsanity setting in the Spyro 2 section of the host.yaml file.  This setting has a substantial impact on generation times (adding 2546 progression items) and can send frequent messages to everyone's client, so not every host will allow these settings.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n- Fixed the indices of 3 gems in Summer Forest and 1 gem in Fracture Hills.\r\n- Removed (again) the beep sound that played when spawning into a level with Gemsanity on.\r\n- For better performance and reduced crash chances, gemsanity checks will only trigger while you are in the same level as the gem.\r\n  - This means that if you collect gems while not connected to the server, you will need to return to the level to trigger the corresponding checks.\r\n  - This should have no impact on normal gameplay.",

If you are playing on the 1.0.1 or 1.0.2 client and cannot update, you can avoid this issue by ending with a manual save, or by using save states.",
