However, any changes to logic will not be applied unless games are regenerated with new apworld.\r\n\r\n**FIXES**\r\n- The quest \"Kushala Daora, Dragon of Steel\" and \"Teostra the Infernal\" should no longer have their checks swapped.\r\n- Fixed the quest \"The Current Situation\" having the wrong location ID.\r\n- Fixed being able to craft armors if you had the materials even if you didn't have the proper progressive armor.\r\n- Fixed not being able to get bandit mantle and hopefully any other specialized equipment that fell under the same issue.\r\n- Removed Mega Dash Juice and Exhaust Phial from the loot pool due to them being unattainable normally and thus unusable.\r\n- Fixed a bunch of logic for Endemic Life. All Iceborne added life has been pushed back to unlocking with master rank. This may change since there is unclear information that if the life unlocks with the DLC or once you reach the DLC content.\r\n- Added support of Archipelago 0.7.0. Might cause issues.\r\n- Fixed a bunch of typos.\r\n\r\n**Known Issues:**\r\n- Currently no logic or testing for non-Iceborne games.
