Since the items are not actually withheld from the player,\nthe player must manually refrain from using these gathered items until the tracker shows that they have been acquired or sent.",

      "description": "This manual is a work in progress and in need of testers. Hence why it is an alpha version.\r\nI know it needs probably better logic.\r\nIt lacks Starting Items so I plan to update that with the next update.\r\nWithin logical reason you can use starting items and weapons (such as the required vulnerary use in the prologue chapter) but for the most part you're meant to wait for other players to send you items, weapons, skills, equipment, units, and class promotions before being able to use them in a playthrough.\r\n\r\nThere are 4 different built-in \"Victory\" points  or \"Goals\" upon completing chapters 8, 17 (Ike's promotion to Lord), Ch. 27 (defeating the Black Knight), and Endgame (Defeating Ashnard). \r\nSo those victory points will trigger your goal and whatever else you have programmed for your AP. So you can manually select one of those depending on how long you want the playthrough to be. \r\n\r\nLooking forward to your feedback/suggestions and then I'll do my best to improve it over time. Thank you to everyone who has tested this manual APworld so far!\r\n\r\nPS: It is recommended to play a new game on a save file that has already finished a play-through. (You don't have to but it will make the Band's you receive via AP items useless) -Note that you will not have checks in your play-through tied to getting the bands as I did not program those as checks. \r\n\r\nSome save game data if you want to pick one that has save data with a cleared playthrough to be able to get the bands in your run: \r\n[Save Game Files](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/gamecube/920189-fire-emblem-path-of-radiance/saves)\r\n\r\nGOAL: \r\nChoose to either complete Chapter 8, complete Chapter 17 (Ike Promotion), Chapter 27 (Defeat the BK), or Defeat Ashnard in the Final Chapter (29) \r\n\r\nCHECKS:\r\nCompleting a story chapter give you a check.\r\nAny units that join you rewards you with a check per unit.\r\nEvery character has a check for their available class change.\r\nEvery chest and visitable house has been organized by chapter.\r\nEvery Item dropped by a boss or an enemy on a \"Rout\" victory condition chapter will give a check.\r\n\r\nFor clarity, when you use the manual:\r\nIke is considered a starting item.\r\nThe trainer weapon is also considered a starting item. (The mandatory vulnerary use that you get from Mist is as well) so you can get through the prologue.\r\nUnfortunately by Chapter 1 if you don't have any of the 4 unit's weapons unlocked you might frequently hit a chapter 1 BK. I'll need to test this further to see how often this happens and what can be done about it. My early thoughts are allow the iron sword to also be a starting item...\r\nClarification on the \"Choose X character\" items: This really only applies to Chapter 8 and onwards. The lack of these items in your playthrough does not impact chapters 1-7 because you don't have the option of choosing your units before you start the map. Starting chapter 8+ you will have to have those specific items to allow you to choose more units besides Ike.\r\n\r\n\r\nOptionally you can also use Lush\u2019s FE Universal Randomizer, \u201cYune\u201d.\r\n[Yune Randomizer](https://github.com/lushen124/Universal-FE-Randomizer/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#fe9)\r\n\r\nAny suggestions/changes/feedback/volunteers to test would be greatly appreciated! \r\n",

(This limits you to only being able to promote the same number of units as total Master Seals you have received) -The game logic already reflects this so it won't expect you to reach a promotion check unless you have a master seal for it (and the item needed to unlock the unit's specific promotion)\r\n**New total of items is:** 269\r\n10. **Added** all missing checks that corresponds to every boss in the game (some were missing). \r\n -This brings the **new total of checks to: 310** \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFire Emblem: Path of Radiance is a 2005 tactical role-playing video game developed by Intelligent Systems and Nintendo SPD, and published by Nintendo for the GameCube. This Manual APworld is for use with the Archipelago randomizer.\r\n\r\nIt still lacks programmed Starting Items so I'll look into that for a future update.\r\nWithin logical reason you can use starting weapons (Ranks E). You can also feel free to use the necessary (vanilla playthrough) vulnerary in the prologue chapter.\r\nOther than that, for the most part, you're meant to wait for other players to send you items, weapons ranks, skills, equipment, units, and class promotions before being able to use them in a playthrough. \r\nIMPORTANT: Each weapon's progressive ranks are included as items you will need to receive in a multi-world AP before you can use the next ranks. This excludes all special or unique weapons however. Also remember that all rank E Weapons are considered starting items. Each progressive weapon rank enables the use of the next rank in that respective weapon category.\r\n\r\nThere are 4 different built-in \"Victory\" points or \"Goals\"\r\n\r\n**GOAL OPTIONS:**\r\n\r\n    Completing Ch. 8\r\n    Ike's promotion to Lord at the end of Ch. 17\r\n    Completing Ch. 27 (defeating the Black Knight)\r\n    Completing Endgame (Defeating Ashnard)\r\n\r\nSo those victory points will trigger your goal and whatever else you have programmed for your AP. So you can manually select one of those depending on how long you want the playthrough to be.\r\n\r\nPS: It is recommended to play a new game on a save file that has already finished a play-through. (You don't have to but it will make the Band's you receive via AP items useless). Getting these Bands are checks/locations.\r\n\r\nSome save game data if you want to pick one that has save data with a cleared playthrough to be able to get the bands in your run:\r\n[Save Game Files](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/gamecube/920189-fire-emblem-path-of-radiance/saves)\r\n\r\n**CHECKS:**\r\nCompleting a story chapter give you a check.\r\nAny units that join you rewards you with a check per unit.\r\nEvery character has a check for their available class change.\r\nEvery chest and visitable house has been organized by chapter as individual checks.\r\nEvery Item dropped by a boss or an enemy will give a check.\r\n\r\nFor clarity, when you use the manual:\r\nAny weapon that is not listed as a receivable item is considered unlocked from the start of the game.\r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT Clarification:** on the \"Choose X character\" items: This really only applies to Chapter 8 and onwards. The lack of these items in your playthrough does not impact chapters 1-7 because you don't have the option of choosing your units before you start the map. Starting chapter 8+ you will have to have those specific items to allow you to choose more units besides Ike.\r\n\r\nOptionally you can also use Lush\u2019s FE Universal Randomizer, \u201cYune\u201d.\r\n[Yune Randomizer](https://github.com/lushen124/Universal-FE-Randomizer/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#fe9)\r\n\r\nAny suggestions/changes/feedback would be greatly appreciated!\r\n",
