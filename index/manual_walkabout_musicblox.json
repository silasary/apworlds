You can pick which courses you want to play in the yaml via their acronym names. Be careful adding too many courses as this can balloon the world up to 2000+ checks!\r\n\r\nPlease make sure to read the readme to get a rundown on how this manual works.\r\n\r\nBig big thank you to @MusicBlox for making the code that generates nearly our entire apworld from one course metadata csv!\r\n\r\nAnd big thanks to @Fairweather-Furry for helping debug on Linux, helping me upkeep the course metadata, and making the little logo on top of our readme!\r\n\r\nIf anyone is on mac and has a problem generating please either create an issue here on github, dm me (energymaster) on discord, or leave a message in the Walkabout thread in the Manual for Archipelago discord server.
