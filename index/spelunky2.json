  "description": "Spelunky 2 is an extremely difficult roguelike platformer where your progression is gated by multiworld unlocks.\nYour ultimate goal is to complete one of the game's various paths. Your primary objective is to complete 'checks' by\ndiscovering new journal entries, which sends an item from the multiworld into the item pool. The rewards you receive\ncan range from simple 'filler' items to world unlocks that allow you to progress, as well as key quest-chain items\nlike the Udjat Eye and Hou Yi's Bow. These critical items must be received from the multiworld before you can obtain\nthem in-game.",

D'oh! So now it works again by getting the data another way\r\n## Some more fixes\r\n- Corrected some of the images in the item alert box being the wrong one\r\n- Corrected the pop-up message's text being able to spill outside\r\n- _(Technically not a fix)_ If it doesn't succeed the TLS connection, it quietly re-attempts without. You'll know if it's secure or not when it says [Secure] Connected or [Fallback] connected\r\n\r\n---\r\nHuge thanks and respect to [Eszenn](https://github.com/Eszenn/) for all the work they did.

Sorry momma!)_\r\n## Easy difficulty has more locked items!\r\nIf you specifically lock some of the quest items on easy; only four are now excluded -- Arrow of Light, Hou Yi's Bow, Tablet of Destiny + Ushabti -- this is to alleviate some important items being gated behind them basically at the end of your game -- this used to be JUST the Alien Compass (Considered \"Quest\" because it's a quest-chain item)\r\n## Excluded locations are now pre-discovered!\r\n\"Huh? I just got Lavamander? But I turned that off!\" -- no more! You've already found it, and your journal reflects that now :)\r\n## World-wrapping makes visual sense now!\r\n\"Wait, I was going into Tidepool, but I'm in Dwelling?\" -- no more! If your being sent back the transition screen (for as brief as it is...) will correctly show where your going (It's real weird seeing Ice Caves -> Dwelling!!)\r\n## The journal is multi-world updated!\r\nWhen you receive a location if it's one from your own world and for _whatever reason_ your local game doesn't have that journal entry? it's automagically done now! You could technically have 2 people playing from the same slot and it'll sync up... (I think... feel free to try and let me know!) But at the very least if your save gets messed up somehow you can delete it and you lose **_no_** progress\r\n## Bug fixes!\r\n- Re-fixed character not being unlockable (I made a last-minute change and broke things bad... sorry!)\r\n- The game properly closes the Archipelago connection if your quitting (TL;DR ? it closes instantly rather than linger for like... 3 seconds)\r\n---\r\n# Huge thanks and respect to [Eszenn](https://github.com/Eszenn/) for all the work they did.

Now you can ignore (0 -> 10) of their deaths before it kills you..\r\n## Moar Deathlink options\r\nIn-game (CTRL + F4 to bring up the menu in-game if you need to) you can turn off deathlinks wholesale (reserve it for problems...) or make it that rather than immediately dying you explode instead which you _might_ survive\r\n## Iron-man Mode!\r\nIf you used a shortcut, you won't be allowed into your goal world. Get there properly!\r\n## ALL THE DAMSELS!\r\nYou like Doge-only? Well, we need you to find hampster and catto too! So we'll just swap them in until you send their checks ;)\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes!\r\n- Coffins are _**for real this time**_ sorted.\r\n- Cosmic Ocean not having the right amount of CO checkpoints (Thanks @thejoshwolfe )\r\n- Deathlink is no longer super laggy (and doesn't send a death if you have an Ankh... derp)\r\n- Hou Yi's Bow + Ankh leave a filler item if they are locked out\r\n- Sunken City skip logic mistake (Thx @sebysebyseby )\r\n---\r\n# Huge thanks and respect to [Eszenn](https://github.com/Eszenn/) for all the work they did. Best of wishes to them.\r\n## Big thanks still goes to @cloiss + (discord) ``activegalacticnucleus`` for their contributions to 0.3.0\r\n\r\n# [Installation Steps here](https://github.com/DDR-Khat/Spelunky2-Archipelago?tab=readme-ov-file#installation-instructions)",

Anything older than 0.3.9 _**WILL**_ break, but 0.3.9 had some dumb bugs so you should just update to this.\r\n# What's New\r\nJust fixes, sorry.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes!\r\n- Starter character's locations are NOT added the multiworld (Roffy, stop holding important Multiworld items! We already HAVE you!!)\r\n- Added extra delay after receiving deathlink (stop killing people because you were killed by exploding, silly)\r\n- \"ALL\" locked items option is no longer breaks everything (Turns out, missing important values breaks stuff... who knew?)\r\n- Deathlinks out of game are now ignored (Who even dies when we've not even started the sync? Turns out there are some...)\r\n- Removed \"Shield\" from default Waddler options (It causes things to get crushed, crazy, I know)\r\n- Gracefully handle and warn when filler/trap weights aren't set up right. (Some people just put everything to 0. Weird.)\r\n---\r\n# Huge thanks and respect to [Eszenn](https://github.com/Eszenn/) for all the work they did.
