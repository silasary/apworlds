      "description": "## Hotfix\r\n- This is a hotfix for [v0.0.10-preview](https://github.com/JammyGeeza/Stacklands-Randomizer/releases/tag/v0.0.10-preview) that fixes a game-breaking issue with random card generation, making it not possible to draw cards from some packs and not craft some items.\r\n\r\n# !!! THIS IS A PREVIEW AND MAY NOT BE STABLE !!!\r\nThis release has new features and fixes that I have **_not yet been able to properly test_**, so any support with testing and feedback on this would be very helpful and appreciated, if at all possible!\r\n\r\n## New Feature(s)\r\n**Trap Items** are supported, currently including two traps:\r\n  - `Get Gooped!`\r\n  - `Get Pooped!` \r\n\r\nBoth of the above will spawn 20 of each item randomly across the board. It's more of a nuisance trap at the moment, but with vision to include Enemy Spawn traps in future.\r\n\r\n**_NOTE_**: Trap items can be toggled on/off with `include_traps` in the `.yaml` if you don't want them.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- The following Location Checks have been **_removed_**, as they are not Mainland quests so did not actually trigger:\r\n  - `Build a Garden`\r\n  - `Build a Mine`\r\n  - `Build a Sawmill`\r\n  - `Build a Smithy`\r\n- The following Location Checks have been **_added_** as they are achievable on Mainland _(only filler items will be placed in them due to how RNG-based fulfilling these quests are!)_:\r\n  - `Train an Archer`\r\n  - `Equip an Archer with a Quiver`\r\n- The following Items have been **_added_** to the item pool:\r\n  - `Idea: Charcoal` _(useful)_\r\n  - `Apple Tree x3` _(filler)_\r\n  - `Berry x5` _(filler)_\r\n  - `Coin x5`, `Coin x10`, `Coin x25` _(filler)_\r\n  - `Egg x5` _(filler)_\r\n  - `Iron Deposit x3` _(filler)_\r\n  - `Milk x5` _(filler)_\r\n  - `Stick x5` _(filler)_\r\n  - `Tree x3` _(filler)_\r\n- \"Basic Items\" list has been expanded to provide a better variety of possible items that will replace randomly spawning ideas _(such as from the `Old Tome`)_\r\n- Card-blocking logic should no longer prevent `Island` ideas from spawning if your goal is set to `Kill the Demon Lord`. Although The Island isn't actually supported yet, it might now make this achievable. However, it will mean half of your run has no checks so I would probably still avoid this goal for now.\r\n- Selected goal from the yaml is now no longer treated as a location check in the check pool.\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n- DeathLink should no longer always think it is not enabled, despite the yaml config.\r\n- DeathLink tag should not be included twice.\r\n\r\n## Important\r\nTo ensure that this mod works as expected, please make sure to only use the provided `.apworld`, `.yaml` and `.zip` files together in this release.\r\n\r\n## How to Install / Use the Mod\r\nAll instructions for how to install and use the mod are in the [README.md](https://github.com/JammyGeeza/Stacklands-Randomizer/blob/main/README.md)",

      "description": "## Changes\r\nRules have been completely re-worked and improved to better balance the progression. The `Kill the Demon` goal is now classed as 'logically reachable' when the player has _all_ of the following:\r\n- Ability to create `House` and `Offspring`\r\n- Ability to create `Iron Bar` and `Smelter` _(which subsequently include needing `Plank` and `Brick`)_\r\n- Ability to perform `Growth` and build a `Shed` and a `Garden`\r\n- Ability to create a `Campfire` and `Cook Raw Meat`\r\n- Ability to `Train Militia`, `Train a Wizard`\r\n- Able to find the `Golden Goblet`\r\n\r\nYou are able to skip some of this logic in cases where you receive RNG dropped items like `Plank`, `Brick`, `Iron Bar` etc, but these rules are a good starting point to pave a playable progression so you don't get too stuck.\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n- `basic_pack` option in YAML is **no longer supported**, as the above changes help balance the progression so you _should_ always receive the `Humble Beginnings Booster Pack` very early on without getting stuck.\r\n- `start_inventory` option in YAML is now supported, so if you would like to always begin with `Humble Beginnings Booster Pack` _(or any other item, for that matter)_ then include it here:\r\n```\r\nstart_inventory:\r\n{\r\n    'Humble Beginnings Booster Pack': 1,\r\n    'Other Item Name Here': 1,\r\n    etc...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n- `Old Tome` item can now no longer spawn `Idea: ` items.\r\n\r\n## Important\r\nTo ensure that this mod works as expected, please make sure to only use the provided `.apworld`, `.yaml` and `.zip` files together in this release.\r\n\r\n## How to Install / Use the Mod\r\nAll instructions for how to install and use the mod are in the [README.md](https://github.com/JammyGeeza/Stacklands-Randomizer/blob/main/README.md)",

      "description": "# THIS VERSION HAS BEEN HOTFIXED - 3RD SEPTEMBER 2025\r\nThis version previously had a bug that prevented players receiving `Idea: Charcoal` which also caused item sync issues with the server. If you installed `v0.2.0-alpha` on or before 3rd September 2025, please replace your mod install with the [StacklandsRandomizer.v.0.2.0-hotfix.zip](https://github.com/JammyGeeza/Stacklands-Randomizer/releases/download/v0.2.0-alpha/StacklandsRandomizer.v0.2.0-hotfix.zip) file from this release. This will not affect your current run and should continue working as normal.\r\n\r\n## Information\r\nThis mod is currently in alpha, so it is possible that it may contain bugs or issues - please familiarise yourself with the [known issues list](https://github.com/JammyGeeza/Stacklands-Randomizer/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen) before using this mod to see how your experience may be affected and use at your own risk.\r\n\r\nIf you experience a bug/issue that is _not_ in the list, please raise a new github issue or post it in the [Stacklands Forum in the Archipelago Discord Server](https://discord.com/channels/731205301247803413/1151149079238299719)\r\n\r\n_**PLEASE NOTE:** To ensure that this mod works as intended, please **only** use the provided `.apworld`, `.yaml` and `.zip` files together in this release._\r\n\r\n## How to Install / Use the Mod\r\nAll instructions for how to install and use the mod are in the [README.md](https://github.com/JammyGeeza/Stacklands-Randomizer?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-install-the-mod-to-stacklands)\r\n\r\n## Patch Notes\r\n### General\r\n- **The Island** is now supported! \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udfdd\ufe0f\r\n- Additional basic, custom quests added for Mainland / Forest / Island to the location check pool to allow for a more generous amount of expansion / filler / trap item slots.\r\n- Deathlink has now moved to the in-game **Mods menu** and can be toggled on and off.\r\n- The `Resource Booster Pack` filler item has now been split into `Mainland Resource Booster Pack` and `Island Resource Booster Pack` items and each will spawn on their respective boards and will give board-specific items.\r\n- The `Board Expansion` item has been split into `Mainland Board Expansion` and `Island Board Expansion` items and will each spawn on their respective boards. The `board_expansion_count` YAML option will generate the count of expansion items for _both boards_.\r\n\r\n### APWorld / YAML Updates\r\n- `Goal` option updated to include **Kill the Demon Lord** into the goal. \r\n  - Selected goals (Kill the Demon / Fight the Wicked Witch / Kill the Demon Lord) will automatically include all quests from their respective boards as location checks.\r\n- `Equipmentsanity` option adds location checks for crafting each individual `equipment` card. _(E.g. Club, Iron Shield, Blunderbuss etc.)_\r\n- `Foodsanity` option adds location checks for cooking each individual `food` card. _(E.g. Stew, Fruit Salad, Tamago Sushi etc.)_\r\n- `Locationsanity` option adds location checks for exploring each individual `food` card. _(E.g. Old Village, Plains, Jungle etc.)_\r\n- `Structuresanity` option adds location checks for building each individual `structure` card. _(E.g. Garden, Market, Distillery etc.)_\r\n- `Mobsanity Balancing` option to greatly increase chance of spawning un-killed Mobs from **Booster Packs / Strange Portals / Dark Forest Waves** - this helps prevent having to rely on RNGesus to spawn all mob types to reach all `Mobsanity` checks.\r\n\r\n### UI / QoL Updates\r\n- New setting in Mods menu to toggle **Deathlink**.\r\n- New setting in Mods menu to toggle **auto-connect** to the archipelago server on game boot.\r\n- New setting in Mods Options to **hide all completed checks** from the quest log.\r\n\r\n### Other Updates\r\n- Access rules completely re-written for _(hopefully)_ better item spread and balance across the spheres and also to help increase chances of receiving weapons earlier to help fend off strange portal waves.\r\n- Supports `Archipelago v0.6.3` for seed generation.\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n- Fixed #63 - Seed generation should no longer struggle to 'progression balance' items.\r\n- Fixed #64 - Mobsanity mobs from un-selected boards should no longer appear as checks.\r\n- Some additional preventative measures to stop `Feed Villagers Trap` and `Sell Cards Trap` from being triggered while in The Dark Forest.",
