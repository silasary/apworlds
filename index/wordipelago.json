      "description": "## What is this game?\r\n\r\nEveryone knows the word guessing game that was bought by the NY Times.\r\nThis is a Wordle randomiser built from the ground up to work with Archipelago.\r\n\r\nYou start with a limited number of letters (just a single letter by default), a reduced number of guesses, missing features such as show misplaced letters as yellow, and greying out wrong letters.\r\nThis means that guesses have to be possible with just a single letter, and so the normal limitation of guesses having to be a real word has been removed.\r\nIf you use all your guesses without getting the word, you have to wait for a cooldown before you can get a new word to guess.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to guess a certain number of words with options for even more of a challenge.\r\n\r\nItems to unlock in the game are:\r\n- The ability to use the rest of the letters\r\n- showing of yellow letters\r\n- Greying out of wrong letters\r\n- More guesses\r\n- Reduced cooldown time\r\n\r\nLocations to find checks are:\r\n- Successfully finding each letter in any word\r\n- The first time you find 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 letters correct in a word\r\n- Guessing each word up to your goal\r\n\r\nIt's all build in JavaScript so it can run in most modern HTML5-capable browsers.\r\nIt's resumable from anywhere, so you can very easily switch machines you're playing on, everything catches up as soon as you connect.\r\n\r\n## What is included in this release\r\n\r\nThis release is the initial work for the wordipelago apworld. fully functional and compatible with the latest deployment to [Wordipelago Game](https://apworlds.com/wordipelago)",
