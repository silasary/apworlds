Extra locations have been added to all deliveries instead of just those who give items in vanilla, one for just chatting and one for getting their package delivered. The goal is to get back to your air balloon and continue your route (and hopefully deliver all the packages as you go.)\r\n\r\n### Launching the Air Delivery Client\r\n\r\nThe index.html file in the Client folder can be opened in any web browser, then submit the Hostname, Port, and Name for the connection\r\n\r\nAn example:\r\n* Hostname: archipelago.gg\r\n* Port: 38281\r\n* Name: Player1\r\n\r\nYou will then see a `Connected` message showing that you have connected properly, and you can continue to play the game.\r\n\r\n### Running the game\r\n\r\nThe game can be played before or after Connecting, but make sure if you are switching slots to reset the game so that your inventory and sent locations are not carried over into the new slot\r\n",
