      "description": "Hopefully the final version of 0.3! Unless we find some horrible bug that can't afford to wait for the next major version, but _hopefully_ that won't happen. We're hoping to move onto proper development of 0.4, and get working on some new content.\r\n\r\nAs per usual, do keep in mind that different APWorld versions aren't designed to be compatible, so make sure the player uses the same version that was used to generate the game.\r\n\r\n Quite a few things have been fixed between 0.3.1 and now, so here's the list of (hopefully) fixed issues:\r\n* Pelipper will no longer try to deliver items behind a FadeOutAll where textboxes are hidden. This is a specific type of fade that's only used in a few cutscenes, so this will only fix a rare \"softlock\" where the game gets stuck on a black screen (though you could just keep pressing A until you got through all the Pelipper text). (#173)\r\n* The 100k Duskull Bank check won't send out early. (#174)\r\n* Job requests that contain hints will no longer appear on the Outlaw board, as all of the hints are written as non-outlaw jobs. (#175)\r\n* Seven Treasures missions will unlock their dungeon properly, and _shouldn't_ be missable. (#176 #177)\r\n* A few typos were fixed. (#183 #198 #210)\r\n* Some tracker text was corrected to clarify that rule dungeons are non-essential *only* when long locations are off. (#185)\r\n* **Talking to the partner will no longer cause random crashes in the same room!** The script was super big, causing it to overflow and overwrite data for other scripts in the room. We've split it into multiple separate scripts, so no more overflows! (#186 #221) We hope that this should fix a couple of other bugs that we weren't able to otherwise reproduce:\r\n  * ~~The \"Sure To Win\" diary entry should no longer crash in Bidoof's Wish.~~ **Edit**: This is still happening. Avoid reading diary entries in special episodes (opening the diary itself to claim a check is fine.) (#209)\r\n  * The Regigigas Chamber in Aegis Cave should now function properly. (#227)\r\n* Clearing the Fighting/Psychic Dojo in Today's \"Oh My Gosh\" should no longer unlock all other dojos. (#187)\r\n* The Ludicolo Dance check should send out properly. (#188)\r\n* Wobbuffet will no longer duplicate items when stacking them in your bag. (#189)\r\n* The tracker should now consistently show info for the correct dungeon ID. (#191)\r\n* Star Cave is now treated as an early dungeon by both the ROM and client; they were desynced before, potentially making some checks inaccessible. (#193)\r\n* Having a tilde or square bracket in a slot name will no longer cause connecting to fail; we now store the proper slot name and the \"EoS-friendly\" slot name separately, with the former being used for connecting. (#194)\r\n* Sending mission checks for rule dungeons or a few miscellaneous dungeons (such as Temporal Tower) will no longer softlock the game. (#195)\r\n* Removed a few hardcoded dungeon unlocks; namely, the Star Cave unlock from Jirachi's challenge letter and the Labyrinth Cave unlock from the Gabite Scale mission. (#196 #199)\r\n* The Touch Grass trap will no longer use the beach bubbles scene; this seems to *really* like crashing, and we still don't know why. Hopefully we can bring it back in the future, but for now we've just forced it to reroll when it rolls the beach scene. (#197)\r\n* Having too high of a guild rank will no longer cause Aegis Cave boss fights to be skipped, making their checks inaccessible. (#200)\r\n* The Drowzee crossroads hint now displays properly. (#201)\r\n* The Recycle Shop Dungeon 5 check will now send properly. (#202)\r\n* Torkoal's hints are now in the right order; the hint names match where they're actually found. (#203)\r\n* Receiving Sentry Duty during certain cutscenes will no longer break cutscene flow, potentially causing loss of progress. (#205)\r\n* The Team Name Location check now logically requires the Main Game Unlock item. (#211)\r\n* The Sneasel's Gratitude check will now send out properly. (#214)\r\n* **The instrument/RFS count will _finally_ stay in sync,** thanks to backend rewrites! (#215)\r\n* Fixed a rare scenario where the font would be completely messed up after the credits, resulting in some very funny Dialga text. (Technically we just force-reset the font after the credits, but if it works it works.) (#217)\r\n* ~~**The top screen tracker should no longer cause crashes!!**~~ This one has been a thorn in our side for a *while*. For the uninformed, leaving the tracker open for too long could cause lag, and eventually memory overflows that would crash the game and send out a ton of checks and goal. This should no longer happen, everyone say thank you Hecka! **Edit**: This can still happen, but it's MUCH more rare. Just don't use the tracker on any page with the spinning animation (Hidden Land, Temporal Tower, Dark Crater) and you'll be fine. (https://github.com/Chesyon/eos-archipelago-patches/issues/17 #218)\r\n* The Denched Bluff lookalike dungeon will now work properly even after clearing Beach Cave, instead of sending you to the Beach Cave bossfight for some reason. (#220)\r\n* Missions in The Nightmare now logically require Mt. Bristle. (#225)\r\n* ~~'Fixed' a weird issue where team members would have their stats revert back to an old state, resulting in loss of progress. Not sure how this happened, but Lappy now manually saves the stats, so hopefully that fixes it.~~ **Edit:** Seems like this is still happening rarely. We have theories but no confirmation yet. Please let us know if you encounter this. (#226 #234)\r\n* Losing in the Deep Star Cave bossfight will now still send out the check, as it shouldn't matter whether or not you lose this fight. (#228)\r\n* Hints should no longer display wonkily when using characters not in the game's font; they're properly converted to Windows 1252 instead of staying in UTF-8. Also added an edge cases where we use special characters from the game's font when available (currently just the \u2605 character; we'll probably add more in the future.) (#229)\r\n* The way missions are handled by the client has gone under major improvements, and should no longer be able to permanently skip mission checks. (#232)\r\n* ~~Manaphy should no longer randomly show up in the guild on a Dialga goal.~~ **Edit:** May still be happening rarely. Please let us know if you encounter this. (#233)\r\n* The way legendaries are sent by the client has gone under major improvements, so legendaries should no longer be duplicated. We hope. (#236)\r\n* Oh, and we have a manifest now, so things should work on Archipelago 0.7. Yay.\r\n\r\n_Hoo_, that was a lot. That took what, 45 minutes to write? Yeah. Anyways, there are a bunch of issues where we just have to try to make fixes and then wait to see if anyone reports the issue still happening in a release candidate. As such, it's always possible that a fix _doesn't_ work and we just didn't know about it. If you find that **any** of the bugs above are still present in this version, please go to their issue page and leave a comment letting us know!\r\nThanks for playing!",
