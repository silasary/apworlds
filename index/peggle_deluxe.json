      "description": "_Peggle Deluxe - A pachinko-inspired arcade game by PopCap Games_\r\n\r\n**Randomizer Features**\r\n* All 55 Quick Play levels + 10 Peggle Masters supported\r\n* Ability to select individual levels to include / exclude from generation\r\n* Ability to select individual masters to include / exclude from generation\r\n* Ability to customize how many levels to play (5-55)\r\n* Ability to customize how many masters are available for play (1-10)\r\n* Ability to set / randomize difficulty of target scores. By level or globally\r\n* Ability to convert filler items into useful items during generation to provide additional help\r\n* Starting Ball Count / Fever Meter logic\r\n* Scales well for all types of multiworlds: Short / Long Syncs, Asyncs; ~50-750 checks\r\n* Custom client UI that displays important information and updates in real-time (see screenshot)\r\n* No modding! Only light memory manipulation that works directly from the client\r\n* Universal Tracker (UT) fully supported (and recommended for guidance). YAML-free!\r\n\r\n**How it works and what to expect**\r\n- A custom campaign of N levels is generated based on your settings\r\n- You are granted a starting level and master where you are able to complete your first location checks\r\n- You start with only 5 balls, but can receive more\r\n- Your fever meter is capped at each multiplier, but you can receive upgrades\r\n- You progress through the campaign by receiving level unlocks and progressive items\r\n- You will also gather some gold pegs along the way. These are needed for both goal types. Either:\r\n  - Collect N gold pegs to unlock a final level and clear it to win\r\n  - Collect N gold pegs to win\r\n- Each master's power is usable right away\r\n- Your playthrough will have you jumping between levels as you unlock more stuff, not just beating levels and moving on\r\n- The game is one the shorter side, with high check density. It is on the easier side, save for high tier scores and full clears\r\n- Since the game hasn't been deeply modified, you won't be prevented from playing anything. That said, locations checks will only be registered when meeting the proper requirements\r\n\r\n**Locations**\r\n- Fever Meter Multipliers (2X, 3X, 5X, 10X)\r\n- Level Clears\r\n- Target Scores (Low / Mid / High)\r\n- Style Shots\r\n- Orange Peg Combos (3X, 5X)\r\n- Peg Combos (7X, 15X)\r\n- Full Clears (optional)\r\n\r\n**Items**\r\n- Level Unlocks\r\n- Master Unlocks\r\n- Progressive Fever Meter Thresholds (Locks Fever Meter Multiplier, Level Clear and Target Score locations)\r\n- Progressive Starting Ball Increases (Locks Target Score and Full Clear locations)\r\n- Gold Pegs (Macguffins)\r\n- Level-specific useful items to progressively make things (even) easier: Fever Meter Permanent Bonuses, Full Clear Discounts, Score Multipliers, Target Score Discounts\r\n\r\n<img width=\"795\" height=\"1059\" alt=\"Screenshot 2026-02-08 184610\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccf045af-6d4b-4dd7-8e23-f6f41807c6bc\" />\r\n",
