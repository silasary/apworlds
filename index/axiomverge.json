This can be avoided by not touching any input until the item screen has finished displaying, or by re-creating the save if a crash does occur. If you experience issues outside of this, please let us know!\r\n\r\n**APWorld**\r\nLogic changes/fixes:\r\n- Move Primordial Caves Lower access with just Red Coat into Obscure skips\r\n- Add High Jump as a co-requirement for West Caves access with just Trenchcoat\r\n- Add Red Coat alternative to Drone requirement for Eribu Sentry Bot Tunnel\r\n- Add Any Coat as a co-requirement to Bomb access to glitch a Sentry Bot in said tunnel\r\n- Add Displacement Warp option to Zi Lower Save Secret (thanks Athebyne!)\r\n- Move Kur - Main Shaft from Upper Kur region to Lower Kur\r\n- Add Displacement Warp option for Kur - Main Shaft (thanks Athebyne!)\r\n- Add solo Drone as able to get Zi - False Ceiling Alcove (you guessed it, thanks Athebyne)\r\n- Add Scissor Beam to weapons able to open Absu - Switch Cage (yeah, this one surprised me too)\r\n- Fix some mix-ups in the logic of Cliffs Behind Gir-Tab shrine checks.\r\n- Fix several instances of \"FlameThrower\" being \"Flamethrower\", causing it to not be considered in logic\r\n- Fix Indi -> Ukkin-Na connection having an \"and\" instead of \"or\" on it's Grapple Clip alternative, causing it to never be in logic except on the hardest Grapple clip difficulty.\r\n- Fix some enemy locations deliberately but incorrectly not placed in Ukkin-Na.\r\n- Rework Edin - Sky Cage. It will now never expect a Grapple for access unless _both_ Roof clips and Obscure skips are enabled.\r\n- Rework ascension rules for E-Kur-Mah shaft. Flight now works, and moved the ledge Grapple to Obscure skips.",

Defeat the 8 bosses (Xedur, Telal, Uruku, Gir-Tab, Ukhu, Clone, Sentinel, and Xedur Hul), then defeat Athetos.\r\n- New start: Kur peak. Begin outside of E-Kur-Mah, and descend the mountain.

If it's below what the client expects, the connection will be refused with an error message.\r\n\r\n**Client**\r\n- Return to start no longer crashes the game when used in the in-game randomizer mode.\r\n- The \"inactive world\" state, that disables upon picking up an item, has been removed for AP.\r\n- Improvements to stability of receiving items. Please continue to report if you encounter weird behaviour in this space.\r\n- Skip hallucination sequence in AP.\r\n- Hide speedrun timer in AP. Boss kill times are still displayed as a means of Boss Rush tracking (until something better comes along...?)\r\n- By community request: Always spawn Duraga in Vision room.\r\n- Restore the sent item message box accidentally deleted when glitchsanity was implemented.\r\n- Various error handling around the initial connection. Should handle common pitfalls, and provide a more helpful log.\r\n- AP saves now store the seed of the room, and validate that seed against the new connection on resuming.\r\n- Client version displays on title screen.\r\n- Client doesn't attempt to send glitchsanity locations when glitchsanity is not enabled.\r\n- Client will discard item received prompts after goaling. If the save file is reloaded, prompts will continue to appear as normal. \r\n\r\n**APWorld**\r\n- Fix incorrect access rule on East Edin Will-o-Wisps.\r\n- Remove Vision related logic.\r\n- Simplify Above Vision Room requirement to just Drone, with the permanent Duraga change.\r\n- Audit all Node requirements, they all respect the require_nodes option now.\r\n- Add a Telal -> Lower Absu region connection.\r\n\r\n## 0.3.1\r\n- Fix access rule on Ukhu Spawn in glitchsanity.\r\n- Allow Drone Tele to access upper Ukkin-Na, now hallucination is gone.\r\n",
