      "description": "**NOTE:** This version has breaking changes! Only use this client and this apworld together. **Previous versions are incompatible with this release!**\r\n\r\n### Changelog (0.7.1 -> 0.8.0)\r\n\r\n#### Client\r\n* **Install method change:**\r\n  * This client **no longer uses ASI Loader** to inject into the game. Going forward this client will be distributed as a zipped collection of `dsound.dll`, `SWR_AP_Client.ini` and `APCpp.dll` which will all need to be placed **in the game's main folder**. Players with previous installations should delete their ASI Loader dll and scripts folder before installing this version.\r\n* **Save location change**:\r\n  * Starting this version each slot and seed will create its own save folder (within `ArchipelagoSaves` in the main directory). If you connect and go \"where are my saves???\", that's why. Your vanilla saves and saves from other seeds will not be visible once everything is connected. They are not being deleted!\r\n* **New client config file options**:\r\n  * `waittime`: Adds additional milliseconds before running client code and patching the game. Adjusting this is not advised and should generally not be necessary for most users.\r\n  * `hidepurchases`: Removes purchased items from Watto's shop to cut down on clutter. When you are purchasing an item it is still replaced with a tiny Watto model, but on subsequent visits that item will not be loaded. Keeping this disabled retains the previous shop behavior.\r\n* **Pit Droid Shop change**:\r\n  * There was a bug with previous versions where the pit droid shop didn't do a good job of tracking whether its locations had been sent to the server, and as a result it could become impossible to check some of them in certain cases. This client will track that more closely, and instead of modifying what checks are available to the player, it will simply not charge the player 1000 Truguts if that location was already checked.\r\n  * This means that in asyncs you will see upon relaunching that you will have 3 checks there again, even if you purchased them. *This isn't ideal and will be addressed in a future update*, but you will only be charged for droid checks the server has not marked as completed already.\r\n  * Please note you will still need at least 1000 Truguts to perform these checks, even if you aren't actually charged for them.\r\n* **Faster item processing**:\r\n  * Backend changes to how items are processed have reduced the need for delays between receiving them.\r\n* **Crash Logs**:\r\n  * The client now makes use of a crash logging library to dump some useful information into a folder helpfully called `crash_dumps`.\r\n\r\n#### apworld\r\n* **Changed option: `Course Unlock Mode`**:\r\n  * New settings are `Full Shuffle`, `Circuits` and `Progressive Circuits`. The circuit modes now both treat the Invitational Circuit just like the others, with the vanilla unlocks option removed. This was done largely to simplify the logic and remove generation errors. With the ongoing client restructure, vanilla unlocks could potentially make a reappearance down the line, but for now they are being shelved. `Full Shuffle` is the default recommended mode now.\r\n  * Circuit pass modes now retain \"Course Unlock\" checks and place appropriate \"vanilla\" items on them to unlock the next course in the circuit. \r\n    * As an example, completing `Amateur Race 1 - Course Unlock` will award an `Amateur Course Unlock` item. This bypasses the vanilla game unlocking code and brings these modes closer in-line with how `Full Shuffle` works.\r\n* **Option `Shop Costs` default changed**:\r\n  * `Normalized` is now the default setting to soften some of the outlier expensive purchases in the shop and reduce grind.\r\n* .apworld now contains manifest for eventual compatibility with Archipelago 0.7.0 when it releases.\r\n* Lambda capture issues resolved (special thanks to Mysteryem!)",
