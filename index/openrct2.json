Guests holding food will have their nausea maxed out. Thanks AuGold!\r\n- Removed icon that was technically breaking the GPL3 license. \r\n- When guests prefer less/more intense rides, the shop will no longer ask for requirements on rides that don't make sense, i.e. Roller Coasters won't have a minimum guest requirement when guests prefer less intense rides.\r\n- Awards are now exclusively filler/traps.\r\n- All scenarios now include a log flume, merry-go-round, and 2 food stalls to ensure all awards are permanently obtainable.\r\n- The player was driven mad by High Demon Elgrim!\r\n- The Countdown before a game starts now shows as popups instead of park messages.\r\n- Added an in-game command to change visibility in the unlock shop mid-game.\r\n- Locations can now go to 999 for each color instead of 99. You can put a *ton* of items into a multiworld now.\r\n- Deathlink Popups now always sends a Deathlink, regardless of Deathlink settings.\r\n- \"Snowgrave\" now changes the weather to Snow.\r\n- Lowered the Spam purchase timeout from 2 seconds to .2 seconds.\r\n- Updated the Tutorial to reflect new changes.\r\n- Put flashing text to try to get people to READ THE TUTORIAL. \r\n- Change the prices to rides/park entrance to optional every day to cover for a glitch.\r\n- Fixed ride list for multiple scenarios including Hydro Hills, Magic Quarters, and Gentle Glen.\r\n- Altered Deathlink to Extend the Deathlink class. Not that this means much to the end user, but hey, at least it's consistent with other games now!\r\n- Games sharing ItemID and LocationID spaces are now compatible with each other. Explorers of Sky will no longer screw with your Unlock shops.\r\n- Clicking on the \"Ducks\" message at the very start of a game will no longer break the unlock shop.\r\n- Awards now properly display in the Unlocked Tab.\r\n- Fixed a bug where skips wouldn't work in certain instances.\r\n- Furry traps now work regardless of in-game language. (#OriginalSentence)\r\n- I wrote a new song for the Mistborn Adventure Game I'm currently playing in! I'm an Iron Puller. ",
