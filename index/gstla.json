Lucky Medal overhaul: When Item Shuffle is set to All Items, there is now exactly one lucky medal marked progression.  All others are marked as filler.  When Item Shuffle is just All Chests and Tablets, then all lucky medals are marked as filler.  There is a lucky medal in a barrel in Lemuria if you need it.\r\n2. New Option: Auto Run\r\n3. The categorization of items being useful vs filler has been updated.  In general if you can rebuy it from the artifact shop, it's marked as useful, otherwise filler (some exceptions apply).  Boots, Rings, and Shirts are all marked as useful as well.  There are also options to mark forgeables and most artifacts as filler.\r\n4. New Option: Scale Mimics, so you don't get destroyed by a high level mimic in sphere 1, but will get appropriately challenged in later spheres (or destroyed if you or your friends go out of logic).\r\n5. New Option: Scale Character Levels, scales the party members by sphere they should be obtained in.  Has a related option for the max level that this should be scaled to, default is 24.\r\n6. Black Crystal and Piers are no longer logically required to enter the ship when the ship starts open or the player starts with a ship.  In fact, Black Crystal is just removed from the item pool in these cases.\r\n7. Hover is now an alias for the item Hover Jade.  The other psynergy items were already aliased.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n1. Fixed an issue where GSLTA could not be part of a multiworld with TUNIC.",

Default is `Doom Dragon`\r\n  - (Super)Bosses can be set as tar... goals.\r\n  - Collectathon Djinn edition. (use `djinn_hunt_count` to set amount needed)\r\n  - Collectathon Summon edition. (use `summon_hunt_count` to set amount needed)\r\n- Added option `random_goals` to randomly select a number of goals from your goals list to be your collective goal.\r\n- Added client commands to be able to know your goal (`goals`) and to track progress (`goals_completed`) to your goal. Unfortunately there currently is no way to show this information in game yet. Once this is possible we will be sure to include it, but for now this will do.\r\n- Haze (Jupiter Djinn at Apoji Islands) now logically requires Lash, note that you can still drop down and sanctum warp out to get the djinn but it will not be logically expected anymore.\r\n- Added many events to boss flags for tracking progress towards goals, comes with minor logic adjustments.\r\n- Added option `disable_shop_gametickets` to give players control if they want shopkeeprs to handout game tickets\r\n- Added gametickets and game ticket rewards as possible fillers to existing filler groups `common_consumable_filler_weight` and `lucky_equipment_filler_weight`.\r\n- Removed guarenteed items from `common_consumable_filler_weight` and `lucky_equipment_filler_weight` in the itempool.\r\n- Fixed an issue where the patch file could not be downloaded from the website.\r\n- More technical side, more information is stored in slotdata so trackers can make use of it. This is mostly focused on the logically and goal relevant things.\r\n",
