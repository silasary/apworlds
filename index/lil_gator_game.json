This release is not backwards compatible with older version of the mod or previously generated multiworlds. This release does generate on both Archipelago 0.6.1 and RC3 for Archipelago 0.6.2, though many of the Universal Tracker features are only available on 0.6.2.\r\n\r\nThis release includes:\r\n- Conversion to rule builder (bundled in the apworld to allow portability)\r\n- Add options for locking pots, chests, races behind items\r\n- Add [Universal Tracker](https://github.com/FarisTheAncient/Archipelago/releases) compatibility features including a map tracker (like Poptracker) that uses the apworld's logic, player location tracking (on AP 0.6.2 only), yaml-less tracking, and showing locations that are out-of-logic on your settings but are available with tricks.\r\n\r\nOn AP 0.6.2, hovering over locations on the map in Universal Tracker will show a tooltip listing the locations available in that square. On AP 0.6.1, this feature is not available.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: This apworld is much bigger (5.3 MB) than prior releases. This result is intentional, and comes from including the map directly in the apworld to enable the Universal Tracker mapping.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Convert apworld over to using rule builder by @roseasromeo in https://github.com/natronium/GatorArchipelago/pull/25\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/natronium/GatorArchipelago/compare/v1.0.2...v1.0.6",

This fix was accomplished by replacing the \"Can Complete Avery\" logic here with a CanReachLocation Avery All NPCs in the goal logic.\r\n- Moved goal logic from entrance to \"Playground\" region to specifically the Victory location. This change is to facilitate the ability to make alternate goals in the future.\r\n- Changed Andromeda logic to include a glider when on \"Harder Ranged Quests\" option, updating Avery All NPCs as well.\r\n- Removed shield jump as an option to reach one pot (\"Tutorial Island - Pot (B1) west of rope to tallest peaks on Tutorial Island\") on a peak on Tutorial Island. I have no idea what the clever route was before, and I don't want anyone else to suffer trying to find it.\r\n- Added Bracelet as a requirement for Mochi and a pot near Mochi (\"Northeast (Canyon) - Pot (D8) on peak northwest of Jada's pump\") because while they might be accessible without it, the route is finicky at best.\r\n- Fixed Tanner's logic, since you don't have to break their pots.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Logic Fixes by @roseasromeo in https://github.com/natronium/GatorArchipelago/pull/28\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/natronium/GatorArchipelago/compare/v1.0.7...v1.1.1",
