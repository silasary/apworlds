Since the items are not actually withheld from the player,\nthe player must manually refrain from using these gathered items until the tracker shows that they have been acquired or sent.",

      "description": "I've been testing with these APWorlds over the last couple of weeks, and I've created a new release that fixes some issues I was running into when testing from this manual specifically. The main thing this adds in is the Progressive Chapters Cleared that were present in my Entropy Zero manuals. This is to circumvent a problem that I would run into specifically with Episode 1. I would do the first chapter in the game, basically abandon the slot into I got Exit 17 and an explosive weapon, and then proceed to do Exit 17 out of logic, meaning I was only effectively playing through 2 chapters on any given seed involving Episode 1. This release fixes that and adds it to HL2 and Episode 2 as well.",
