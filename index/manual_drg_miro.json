  "description": "Manual games allow you to set custom check locations and custom item names that will be rolled into a multiworld.\nThis allows any variety of game -- PC, console, board games, Microsoft Word memes... really anything -- to be part of a multiworld randomizer.\nThe key component to including these games is some level of manual restriction. Since the items are not actually withheld from the player,\nthe player must manually refrain from using these gathered items until the tracker shows that they have been acquired or sent.",

Renamed some yaml options and categories to differentiate between them.\r\n- Choose between short (same options as old version) and long, with the following options: \r\n- Select the number of missions (\"Mining Expedition with Driller\" etc.) in the pool, the number of starting missions, the mission completions required to win.\r\n- Add secondary objectives, warning mutators and anomaly mutators to the item- and location pool.\r\n- Choose the number of Deep Dives, Elite Deep Dives, weekly assignments and season challenges\r\nThis game mode has no weapons or upgrades to unlock, it behaves similar to muse dash song unlocks. Some locations can be completed at the same time if the in-game missions spawn with the correct modifiers for the received items.",
