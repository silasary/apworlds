      "description": "## Two long months of coding, debugging, and play\u2026 and at last! The Grinch apworld is here today! The very first one i've coded, released with such flair. Now that the Grinch is in Archipelago, the chaos is everywhere!\r\n\r\n\r\n### How to Connect & Setup\r\n- No patching required, oh what a surprise! Just open Bizhawk Client and emulator. That\u2019s wise.\r\n- Works on Bizhawk 2.9.1, at least that\u2019s been tried, Other versions? Untested, so proceed open-eyed.\r\n- And yes, you\u2019ll be needing an NTSC Bin ROM, to play The Grinch proper, so stay cool, stay calm.\r\n\r\n\r\n### New Stuff\r\n- **Missions give checks!** Every squash, every gift, complete them, collect them, and watch logic shift!\r\n- **Blueprintsanity!** Each blueprint\u2019s a check, tucked in a corner, or high up a deck.\r\n- **Heartsanity!** Every Heart of Stone that you see, is a location to mark, a new place to be.\r\n- **Unlimited eggs** if you wish, what a treat, Rotten yolks raining down, oh how sweet!\r\n- And the **goal of the run** is a sleigh-building quest: You\u2019ll need vacuums, gadgets, and keys to progress!\r\n\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n- **Need a ROM to generate?** No, not at all.\r\n- **Found a bug?** Head to Discord, give a call! Ping *SomeJakeGuy* for client tech woes, or ping *MarioSpore* if it\u2019s logic that shows.\r\n- **Will `X` be added?** Perhaps down the line. Traps, groups, giftsanity\u2026 ideas sound fine!\r\n- **Why so sexy?** Oh goodness, behave! The Grinch may be cool, but let\u2019s not misbehave!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Known Bugs\r\n- Unlimited eggs. If you shoot City Hall\u2019s clock, may scramble your hearts and your yolk-count in shock. (We *think* it is fixed\u2026 but please send a vid. If you see it again, don\u2019t keep it well-hid!)\r\n- Beyond that? Not much, though chaos will grow\u2026 new edge cases may surface, as all coders know!\r\n\r\n\r\nSo join in the fun, bring mischief and glee, The Grinch in Archipelago is waiting for thee! Squash gifts. Fling eggs, and watch logic bend, for this is the start\u2026 not the ultimate end.",

Perhaps you'll go often, perhaps just a few, And eggs, you may get many, or maybe a few!\r\n- **The Code got a polish!** Refractored, they say! Our thanks to Artamiss for clearing the way! More features are coming, a fanciful queue, For future updates, and the Grinchy things to do!\r\n- **You now pick the Vacuum!** The start of the haul! Whichever bright tube, you can enter it all! First choice is yours now, a wonderful sight, To zoom where you wish, start things off right!\r\n- **New checks** were placed in two spots, it is true, In Crumpit and Who Lake, waiting for you! Take a peek through the telescope, what horrors you'll find, and in the Scoutmaster hut, he's now in a bind!\r\n- **Teleporting power!** A warp quick and grand! To the Computer Room on Mount Crumpit's land! (Hold Start and both Triggers, a magical flip!) Or right to the tippy-top (Start and Both Shoulders for the trip!) This helps when you're stuck in a sticky, tight plight, And locked up in Crumpit without yet your might!\r\n- **Universal Tracker Support!** Universal and bright! Now all of your progress is clear to the sight! No YAML to connect to your slot, we hope you like this one quite a lot!\r\n# Fixes\r\n- **A Known Bug In a Trap** Dumpit-To-Crumpit has a glitch that is known, Where death-scene-Grinch flew to a spot unknown!\r\n- **Early Goaling is back!** Hooray for the change! No waiting forever! No need to delay! A long, boring skip just to be freed! Goal early and fast, no credits to read!\r\n- **YAML Validation** Ringlink is locked\u2014a rule we must employ \u2014 If unlimited eggs are yours to enjoy! No rings when you're bursting with all that you need, A fine rule for fairness, a Grinchy good deed!",

That\u2019s you!:\r\n  - Slime Shooter no longer guards the Generator\u2019s door, enter freely now, it blocks you no more.\r\n  - Who Cloak can sneak you into the Clock Tower too. Not just fashion, but function! Who knew?\r\n  - Pancake is no longer demanded to snag North Shore blueprint, drill house and crow perch rejoice.\r\n  - Fixed a missed logic check: Squashing all Gifts in Who Forest now correctly needs Grinch Copter.\r\n- **YAML changes**. Usable ones, imagine that:\r\n  - `exclude_environments` can now ban whole regions you despise. Gone in one swoop, before generation even tries.\r\n    - Or force filler locations instead if you\u2019re picky but fair. Location groups exist, use them. I swear.\r\n  - `giftsanity`... partial! Removes all Squashing all Gifts mission checks.\r\n  - `missionsanity`:\r\n    - `none` or `individual` now fully remove missions.\r\n    - Most mission items are skipped to help generation behave. Instead, you\u2019ll just get them. How brave!.\r\n    - Exceptions remain: Who Cloak, Cable Card Access Card, Scout Clothes.\r\n  - YAML renames and tweaks continue their spree. Regenerate your YAML? Yes, obviously.\r\n  - Fixed descriptions referencing unused commands; multi-bind is now explained to reduce confusion.\r\n  - A funny option to remove Grinch Copter exists. Slower checks, harder life, true Grinchy bliss.\r\n    - Note: Enabling `exclude_gc` also removes *Squashing all Gifts* missions (hard logic says no).\r\n  - Options tagged [NOT IMPLEMENTED] are officially gone, until they do something real in a future dawn.\r\n  - `progressive_vacuums` is now fully complete, following the original game\u2019s progression. Neat!\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed telescope not retriggering after Dump it to Crumpit.\r\n- Fixed boulder check only sending when pushed left. Rude!.\r\n- Scout Battle checks adjusted: once logic grants the move and you enter the Scout Hut, his clothes are obtained automatically. no more awkward Who wardrobe issues.",

If the names of these checks don't sound quite right to you, please send us a letter (just not by who).\r\n- The `!countdown` command is now twice as much fun, it counts in the game 'til the counting is done! From one to two-hundred-and-fifty-four, the game says it simply won't count any more.\r\n- When you visit a land for the very first time, the check will now pop at the start of the rhyme! It triggers the moment the cutscene begins, not when the Grinch out the vacuum tube, grins.\r\n- The YAML is tidy! The YAML is neat! We\u2019ve grouped all the options to make them a treat. With categories for locations and settings, it\u2019s cleaned up nicely, like the Grinch's inventings.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- The Ring Link was wonky and acting quite strange, so we\u2019ve given the logic a bit of a change! It won\u2019t try to send on the menu or demo, it waits for a file\u2014we\u2019ve gotten the memo.\r\n- We tossed out some commands that did nothing at all, like `/dumpittocrumpit` (it had quite a fall). We swept `/tutorialland` right out the door, but your controller button combos still work as before!\r\n- For Traps and for Fillers, we\u2019ve set a new rule, to keep all the weights in a sensible pool. From zero to one-hundred is where they must stay, so the Grinch doesn't grumble and ruin your day!\r\n\r\nNote: If you\u2019re mid-run and don\u2019t want a fright, don't download the update tonight! This patch changes YAMLs and checks by the score, and old worlds won't open or work anymore. ",

Report bugs and check certain things to make sure everything works as intended.\r\n\r\n# Changes\r\n- Updated to require AP v0.6.6 to encourage people to update with security patch.\r\n- Deathlink! Keep in mind that every area you are able to die in except for Mount Crumpit, Clock Tower, Post Office, & Sleigh Room due to ingame issues I encountered during testing.\r\n- Gadgets are now given to you sooner! No longer you are required to use the computer to get the gadget. Just reload/enter a new area to get the gadgets on demand!\r\n- Sleigh Parts are now items in the pool! Find them through out the multiworld and enter the sleigh ride with the Sleigh Room Key! Because of this, the sleigh part locations are temporarily removed for the time being.\r\n- Grass.\r\n- Presents are in the pool aswell. These are items that do nothing to the game if you decide to not want to add rotten eggs to the pool.\r\n- Mission completion for squashing all gifts should be removed if you exclude at least one subarea per area. For example if you have `giftsanity` enabled and you have excluded on of Whoville's subareas, the mission will be removed.\r\n- Added new `misc_checks` option. Adds various categorized locations in the multiworld. From platforms to killsanity, and other funny locations.\r\n- Few new item/location groups\r\n\r\n# Bug Fixes\r\n- Fixed bug regarding certain locations sending when they should not be.\r\n- Elevator in Mount Crumpit should hopefully be positioned in the right level when using the teleport multibind\r\n- Various small logic tweaks and fixes that went overlooked.\r\n\r\n# Things to do until full release\r\n- Fix Heart of Stone locations sometimes not sending\r\n- Support for incremental location checks\r\n- OR condition addresses for locations\r\n- ~~Fix fuzzer errors~~\r\n\r\nThere are probably many more changes I missed.
