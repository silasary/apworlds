This is work in progress and is planned to be expanded later, but\r\n    what is there should work.\r\n  - Logic and tuning for Adventures of Square [by @frozenLake]\r\n- Change:\r\n  - default `included_levels` value is now `[]` rather than a list of every level\r\n    in every supported wad; the behaviour is the same, but it was getting a bit\r\n    unwieldy.\r\n  - generated PK3 file now includes the selected wad name in the filename, e.g.\r\n    `AP_1234_P1_ToxicFrog.Doom_2.pk3`.\r\n- Fix:\r\n  - In-game timer now counts only time spent in gameplay, not time in menus.\r\n  - In-game timer should no longer double-count gameplay time.\r\n  - APWorld has better error reporting for certain classes of generation errors.\r\n  - Returning to a level where you've previously found some checks will report\r\n    them as collected items, rather than reducing the total item count for that\r\n    level.\r\n  - Keys were not always properly added or removed when returning to earlier\r\n    levels with persistence enabled.\r\n  - Command line arguments emitted by the client for launching gzdoom with now\r\n    always use forward slashes, to avoid escaping issues on windows.\r\n  - HealthPickups are now properly scanned as health, not tools.

This has no effect at present but will be important for\r\n    some TCs later.\r\n  - Scanner now uses the same logic to merge nearby locations as the check\r\n    replacer does, which should improve scanning of levels where items are placed\r\n    on conveyor belts or elevators.",

The categorization\r\n    of health, armour, and ammo items has been improved.\r\n  - Logic files now include information about total monster counts and a list of\r\n    secret sectors.\r\n  - By adding `secret-sector` to included_item_categories, you can turn secrets\r\n    themselves into checks; you get the check as soon as you step into the secret\r\n    sector. Note that these are not currently marked on the map the way item-based\r\n    checks are!\r\n  - New option to release some or all checks in a level when you finish the level,\r\n    for a faster-paced game that's less about check hunting and more about clearing\r\n    maps as quickly as you can.\r\n  - Hints are now available in singleplayer games without needing an AP server\r\n    running! Hint limits are not enforced -- you're on the honour system.\r\n  - The `win_conditions` option lets you specify how many levels you need to clear\r\n    to win the game.\r\n  - `local_weapon_bias` and `carryover_weapon_bias` options for controlling how\r\n    early the randomizer makes weapons available to you.\r\n- Change:\r\n  - All logic files regenerated using the updated scanner.\r\n  - The inventory menu no longer lists items you don't have.\r\n  - Tuning files now include coordinate data to more reliably match in-game checks\r\n    to locations in the logic file, even if location names change.\r\n  - Location names have changed; if there are only a few instances of an item in\r\n    a level, it will try to name it based on compass heading and approximate\r\n    distance from the level center before falling back to coordinates.\r\n- Fix:\r\n  - Map markers were not properly displaying filler/progression status if you\r\n    picked up the automap after entering the map when persistent mode was on.\r\n  - Checks now vanish immediately when picked up, rather than waiting for\r\n    confirmation from the server. (If the server never confirms they will still\r\n    respawn when your reset the level.)\r\n  - `ap_show_check_names` now behaves properly in netplay, and also supports\r\n    checks that don't exist in the world.\r\n  - Unreachable checks now contain `Health` instead of `HealthBonus` and should\r\n    thus work with Chex Quest and other IWADs/IPK3s that don't define the latter.\r\n  - Unreachable checks were visible on the minimap but not in play.\r\n  - `ap_suppress_weapon_drops 3` no longer causes you to spawn without fists.\r\n  - In-game check objects now copy the TID, thing special, and special args from\r\n    the item they replaced, which should hopefully fix some levels that rely on\r\n    ACS scripting when certain things are picked up.\r\n  - `level_order_bias` now rounds to nearest rather than rounding down when\r\n    calculating how many levels you need to beat.\r\n  - Weapon balancing no longer counts unreachable weapons.\r\n  - Locations with the same (X,Y) coordinates but different Z no longer cause\r\n    generation failures.\r\n  - Adventures of Square logic fixes.\r\n",

      "description": "# 0.4.1\r\n\r\nThis is a bugfix release.\r\n\r\nThis release brings significant internal changes to the scanner. Rescanning wads\r\nis not required, but is recommended; the new logic files are smaller, and it\r\nbrings better support for scanning items that are placed partly embedded in\r\nwalls/floors or on elevators/conveyors.\r\n\r\nIn a small minority of cases, rescanning a wad using 0.4.1 will cause some\r\ntuning data generated in v0.4.0 to be invalidated. This only affects certain\r\nUDMF-format maps, and this data will be safely skipped when the tuning file is\r\nloaded. It does not affect tuning data from v0.3.x or earlier.\r\n\r\n- New:\r\n  - the `ap_scan_skip` cvar can be used to skip some levels when scanning,\r\n    even if they are reachable from your starting levels.\r\n  - Locations in the level select tooltips are now sorted alphabetically.\r\n- Change:\r\n  - `pretuning_mode` only overrides the original `MAPINFO` if you also ask for\r\n    `full_persistence`. Leaving it off means you can now do a pretuning run with\r\n    the original WAD's intermission screens, episode divisions, etc.\r\n  - File extensions are now ignored when loading logic or tuning files.\r\n  - The client now writes a separate tuning file for each game session, named\r\n    `{wad name}.{timestamp}.tuning`.\r\n  - Scanner and tuner now use integer positions to identify locations. In rare\r\n    cases (on UDMF maps using fractional actor positions), this may result in\r\n    checks being placed up to 2 world units away from the items they replaced;\r\n    this is unlikely to be noticeable.\r\n- Fix:\r\n  - Scanner now captures object locations at spawn time rather than 1-2 tics\r\n    after spawning.\r\n  - Encountering a logic file with no maps now produces a useful error message\r\n    rather than a division by zero crash.\r\n  - Checks collected via release-at-exit are no longer used for tuning.\r\n  - Map markers now properly follow checks again.\r\n  - Check placement algorithm rewritten. \"Unable to find original item, placing\r\n    check at player\" errors eliminated; checks will now always spawn in the\r\n    correct locations.\r\n  - \"This game was generated on 'easy', but you are playing on 'easy'\" error\r\n    should no longer occur when playing on ITYTD (nor the equivalent on NM!).\r\n  - Adventures of Square now classifies more powerup types properly.\r\n  - Adventures of Square no longer includes cutscene maps in the logic.\r\n  - Items weren't sorted properly in the inventory screen.\r\n",

You must regenerate your template YAML.\r\n\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f This release changes the scanner, but only wads that use the\r\n`specialaction_lowerfloortohighest` level special need to be rescanned. (It also\r\naffects wads that use hubclusters, but those are not yet supported in general.)\r\n\r\nThis is the biggest release so far, and kind of got away from me. It's mostly\r\nbugfixes, and of the new features, most of them are small things laying the\r\ngroundwork for later improvements rather than major stuff that players will\r\nnotice. The most interesting additions, I think, are **beat specific levels as a\r\nwin condition** and **Universal Tracker glitch logic support**.\r\n\r\nThere are also many bugfixes which should improve compatibility with AutoAutoSave,\r\nIntelligent Supplies, Adventures of Square, anything that uses a `TITLEMAP`, and\r\nanything that uses death exits.\r\n\r\n- New:\r\n  - Tuning data for Plutonia [from @Gwen].\r\n  - Partial tuning (22 maps, major items only) for Going Down Turbo.\r\n  - `ap-debug` netevent to dump the AP state to the console.\r\n  - In pretuning mode, keys are now displayed in the inventory menu and can be\r\n    toggled on and off, once you have them; they default off. Note that turning\r\n    a key off after using it to reach checks can generate impossible logic, so\r\n    please be careful.\r\n  - `AP-KEY` messages are now emitted as part of the tuning file for keys that\r\n    exist across multiple maps. (This does not mean that hubmap-based megawads\r\n    are now playable, but it's a step in the right direction.)\r\n  - The client now has an icon in the AP launcher! Contributed by @DwarfWoot.\r\n  - Universal Tracker integration now supports \"glitch logic\"; in UT versions\r\n    that support this (v0.2.8 or later), locations that are out of logic due to\r\n    weapon or difficulty settings, but which are still believed to be reachable\r\n    otherwise, will show up with a different colour in the in-game tracker.\r\n  - `ap_scan_prune` cvar can be used to skip levels entirely when scanning (i.e.\r\n    not even scan them for exits).\r\n  - New win condition: beat specific levels.\r\n- Change:\r\n  - Going Down Turbo logic updated from RC 1.7 to the version released on idgames.\r\n  - Scanner now automatically skips levels with no randomizeable actors in them.\r\n  - Unreachable checks are now placed next to the item they would otherwise have\r\n    replaced, rather than replacing it.\r\n  - In pretuning mode, all items picked up will be immediately vended, the same\r\n    as normal Doom gameplay; the AP inventory is bypassed.\r\n  - Keys are now added to your inventory by spawning them into the world and\r\n    then touching them, similar to how other items are spawned. This should\r\n    hopefully improve compatibility with gameplay mods that implement their own\r\n    keys and then use `replaces` rules to replace the existing keys with them,\r\n    rather than simply reskinning the normal Doom/Heretic keys.\r\n  - Saving your game, collecting a check that contains a normal item (i.e. not a\r\n    key or access token), vending the item, then loading your game now restores\r\n    the item to your AP inventory rather than banishing it forever. This brings\r\n    our behaviour more in line with `apquake`, and means that things like\r\n    quicksaving, grabbing a weapon, then quickloading no longer makes that\r\n    weapon impossible to get.\r\n- Fix:\r\n  - Incorrectly formatted `ap_bank_custom` entries will now be skipped instead\r\n    of crashing the game.\r\n  - Scanner now properly handles `specialaction_lowerfloortohighest`. Heretic\r\n    logic updated accordingly.\r\n  - Scan data for levels is no longer retained in memory once the level logic\r\n    is output. This should improve performance and memory usage when scanning\r\n    very large wads.\r\n  - If you pick up a key that wasn't detected by the scanner (e.g. dropped by an\r\n    enemy or spawned with zscript or ACS), it will now be properly detected and\r\n    will be restored to your inventory when you return to that level.\r\n  - `1000 Lines II` logic was accidentally a duplicate of the `Doom 2` logic.\r\n  - When scanning hubcluster levels, it will bounce between the level being\r\n    scanned and the `GZAPHUB` to force a reset. This may result in an excessive\r\n    number of intermission screens being displayed, unfortunately.\r\n  - Item or location names from other games with quotes or backslashes in them\r\n    should no longer crash gzdoom on startup.\r\n  - Attempting to open the inventory menu when not actually playing an\r\n    AP-randomized game now displays an error message rather than crashing, same\r\n    as the level select menu.\r\n  - Items counter once again properly reflects number of remaining item-based\r\n    checks in the map.\r\n  - `ap_scan_unreachable` is now only checked when exiting the map \"properly\",\r\n    not when using the level select or loading a savegame.\r\n  - The GZDoom<->Client connection is not initialized until you are actually\r\n    in-game even if you are playing a mod that has a `TITLEMAP`. This fixes an\r\n    issue where you could start the client sync while at the main menu and then\r\n    interrupt it by loading a game.\r\n  - Universal Tracker no longer shows `unreachable` locations (i.e. those marked\r\n    in logic as being inaccessible by name means).\r\n  - Universal Tracker is disabled in pretuning mode, as its output is basically\r\n    useless when pretuning.\r\n  - Check spawning is now smarter about what it replaces, and, in particular,\r\n    does not replace invisible tokens. This should fix some issues with\r\n    Intelligent Supplies and AutoAutoSave, among others.\r\n  - Fix issues with the secret and item counts.\r\n  - Linedef-based death exits now function properly (previously only boss-based\r\n    death exits did). In particular this should fix Eviternity.\r\n",

      "description": "# 0.7.0\r\n\r\nThis is a major release. The focus of this release is on adding features needed for hub-based games like Hexen, Faithless, Abysm, etc. This has required many changes to the logic and tuning format and significant internal adjustments.\r\n\r\nAs a secondary change, this also splits wad-specific logic/tuning data into separate apworlds. This makes it easier to share logic with game hosts, speeds up load times, and avoids some issues with AP and Universal Tracker that we were starting to run into by having a single huge apworld. See the updated [support table](/gzap/doc/support-table.md) for a list and download links.\r\n\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f **COMPATIBILITY WARNING** \u26a0\ufe0f\r\n\r\nThis update breaks backwards compatibility in a bunch of ways. Rather than try\r\nto enumerate them all I will just give update instructions:\r\n\r\n- Finish any games in progress.\r\n- Delete your old gzdoom apworld (or apworlds, if you were testing the unstable builds).\r\n- Install the new `gzdoom.apworld`.\r\n- Install the [wad-specific apworlds](/release/apworlds) for any wads you want to play.\r\n- Start up AP and `Generate Template Options`.\r\n- You now have a separate YAML for each WAD, and can configure and play normally.\r\n\r\nIf you are a logic developer, see also the updated [new-wads.md](/gzap/doc/new-wads.md#loading-files-without-adding-them-to-the-apworld).\r\n\r\n- New WAD support:\r\n  - Logic and tuning for `Eviternity` and `Eviternity II`, by Akos.\r\n  - Logic and tuning for `Legacy of Rust`, by RakeVuril.\r\n  - Complete tuning for `The Adventures of Square`.\r\n  - Basic logic for `Arrival`, `Base Ganymede`, `Deathless`, and `Scientist`.\r\n  - Logic and tuning for episode 1 of `Faithless Trilogy`.\r\n  - Compatibility patch for DoomRL Arsenal [by J0osp].\r\n- New scanner and tuner features:\r\n  - `GZAPRC` lump can now define default scanner settings for the wad.\r\n  - `GZAPRC` lump can now define cluster names.\r\n  - Scanner can now find maps to scan via cluster membership as well as (or instead of) following exits.\r\n  - Scanner can add arbitrary tags to the logic header which can then be read by the apworld to adjust logic behaviour.\r\n  - Tuner emits information about which weapons the player has and which maps they have visited.\r\n  - Tuning files can declare regions, with region-wide access rules, and checks can be grouped into regions instead of (or as well as) having their own rules. Regions can be assigned in-game while playing.\r\n  - Region and check access rules can include dependencies on arbitrary weapons, items, or access to other maps or regions.\r\n  - Logic files can now define custom names for locations.\r\n  - Logic and tuning files support multiline entries. If a line ends with `}` it is considered the end of the entry.\r\n  - Trigger-based secrets are now supported in addition to sector-based secrets.\r\n- New apworld features:\r\n  - WAD support split into separate apworlds\r\n    - `gzdoom.apworld` contains common code\r\n    - Each WAD has its own separate apworld\r\n  - Items/locations can now have multiple categories, and existing categories have been decomposed (e.g. `big-health` items now belong to two categories, `big` and `health`).\r\n  - Item/location categories, and combinations thereof, can be used in the YAML in any setting that supports item/location groups; see [the faq](/gzap/doc/faq.md#how-do-item-groups-work-in-the-yaml) for more details.\r\n  - `included_item_categories` can now be used to force entire categories into starting inventory or their vanilla locations.\r\n  - `included_item_categories` now supports keys, weapons, and AP automaps.\r\n  - `included_item_categories` now supports specific item names as well as broader item categories.\r\n  - Internal manifest for compatibility with future AP versions.\r\n  - [Web-based apworld packager](https://toxicfrog.github.io/doom-mods/apworld-generator.html) for logic developers.\r\n- New gameplay features:\r\n  - The inventory screen now lists all keys for the current level. Keys you do not yet have are hintable with `shift-H`. (This is the same mechanism as hinting them from the level select screen, but unlike the level select it lets you choose which order to hint them in.)\r\n  - Auto-release on exit can be made conditional on having all keys for the level.\r\n  - The inventory menu now lets you queue up multiple items and dispenses them all at once when closed.\r\n  - The opacity of uncollected checks can be configured.\r\n- Changed:\r\n  - The scanner now reports the display names for keys as well as the typename. This results in better item and location names for keys in WADs that support key names (i.e. not Doom 1/2).\r\n  - Tuning data is now loaded for a wad when generation starts, rather than on apworld initialization. This makes apworld loading noticeably faster.\r\n  - `allow_secret_progress` yaml option removed. Use `exclude_locations: [\"secret\"]` instead.\r\n  - `MapRevealers` (e.g. Computer Area Map, Map Scroll) are now classified as `powerup` rather than as `map` for the purposes of choosing which locations to randomize.\r\n  - The (poorly named) cvar `ap_scan_keys_always` was removed.\r\n  - `start_with_all_maps` yaml option removed. Use `\"ap_map:start\"` in `included_item_categories` instead.\r\n  - Items which are both powerups and tools, such as the Tome of Power from Heretic, are now classified as `powerup-tool` rather than just `powerup`.\r\n  - Individual `ap_bank_` cvars were removed; `ap_bank_custom` and `ap_bank_other` now support everything you could do with those.\r\n  - Internal changes to how locations are identified in logic, tuning, and internally which should significantly improve logic stability.\r\n- Fixed:\r\n  - When running from an unpacked tarball, gzdoom now locates its files with the rest of the tarball contents rather than in `~/.local/share/Archipelago`.\r\n  - Removed incorrect tuning data for `Doom` and `Doom 2`.\r\n  - Improved and corrected tuning data for `Chex Quest 3` [from wobblefowl].\r\n  - Duplicate puzzle items no long appear at the center of the map.\r\n  - Duplicate keys no longer appear in the item pool.\r\n  - Checks associated with event triggers will now respawn if the map is reset, even if collected, to allow the trigger to be repeated.\r\n- Removed:\r\n  - Tuning data for the following wads was from a much earlier version and could not be upgraded to the new format. They are still playable, but AP will be more conservative about what counts as \"in logic\" than it needs to be.\r\n    - `Doom`\r\n    - `Heretic`\r\n    - `FreeDoom 2`\r\n    - `1000 Lines` and `1000 Lines II`\r\n    - `Demonfear`\r\n    - `MAYhem 2048`\r\n    - `Scythe`\r\n",
