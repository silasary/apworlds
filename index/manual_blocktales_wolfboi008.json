      "description": "Finally, it's ready!\r\n<sub>I hope...</sub>\r\nSorry for keeping you waiting! Prepare yourself, this one is a big one!\r\n\r\n# Known Issues\r\nNone for now.\r\n# Changelog (since last stable release, major updates are in **bold**)\r\n- **This Manual should now be compatible with 0.6.3+ of Archipelago.**\r\n- **Added Pre-Prologue Content.**\r\n  - The battle against the Noob and Helmet Noob doesn't require the Superball, but all later fights technically do. It's just done this way so you can get through the full Tutorial area without having to stop in the middle of it awkwardly.\r\n  - The Noob and Helmet Noob enemy Checks were moved to the Pre-Prologue since you technically now fight them there first.\r\n- **Added Chatsanity and Cutscenesanity.**\r\n- **Added the Disable Post-Goal Content Option.**\r\n- **Added a Goal for beating The Pit.**\r\n- Moved `Snory Bear` Check to the Caves since you find one there first (if fighting every enemy you encounter, which logic mostly assumes you do).\r\n- Renamed the `Ice Storm Past Snowy Bear` Check because Snory Bear is the enemy's name, not Snowy Bear.\r\n- Moved the Banished Knight fight Check from the Enemies section to the Bosses section. Oops.\r\n- Gave the Jeep Minigame Check a currently hidden `Minigames` Category. May or may not be used more in the future, depending on what the game adds.\r\n- Renamed `Mango After Defeating Bigfoot X` Checks to `Mango X From Bigfoot's Tree`.\r\n- Renamed the BUX Item's Category from Shopsanity to Shopsanity Currency, and made sure they will still be removed if Shopsanity is disabled.\r\n- **Added Chapter-based Categories to most of the Checks, excluding Shopsanity.**\r\n- Gave the VLAD Enemy the Enemies Category that it should've already had.\r\n- Changed the Swords to be Useful Items for now (if they weren't already, I forget if I did).\r\n- Added a new Trap Item and Shopsanity Check for the new Tick Tock Card.\r\n- Added an Item for the new Infect card that replaced one of the Charge Cards in Chapter 2.\r\n- **Added Chapter-based Categories to Cards and other Items.**\r\n  - This is so that any Cards or other Items past your Goal will be removed if Disable Post-Goal Content is enabled.\r\n- Added a Check (and Item) for a Happy HP Card found in Chapter 1 that I didn't know existed. (Thank you, @Xenophane12!)\r\n- **Added Solo Mode, which removes some Cards and other Items if enabled.**\r\n  - Recommended to enable if you plan to play the game on your own for the Multiworld, rather than with friends.\r\n- Added Checks in Roadtown for the Cookie and Gros' Apple Pie.\r\n- Added Check for Red Pepper in Plains.\r\n- Added Check for Turitopulis Apple Pie from Gemi.\r\n- **Superball is now logically needed for battles, and Ball is now logically needed for the overworld.**\r\n  - Because of this, you need Superball to go past Bizville and into Roblox HQ onward, and then you'll need Ball to go through part of Caves onward.\r\n- Renamed `BUX with Fire Ants` Check in the Caves to `BUX with Fire Ants in Caves`. Just because.\r\n- **Added I Spy Logic to some of the more hidden BUX, requiring you to logically have I Spy to get them.**\r\n- Fixed the names of two Checks in the BUX shop since the Cards were changed in Demo 4.\r\n  - Also added a 3rd Resurrect Card to the pool to accommodate for this.\r\n- **Added an Option to enable or disable the BUX Shop Checks being hinted at the start of the Multiworld.**\r\n- Probably some fixes and small things I've forgotten that aren't part of this list.\r\n\r\nOnce Demo 5 releases, I'll probably play it once or twice before beginning to work on Version 5.0.0, which should hopefully include Chapter 4 and possibly Chapter 5.\r\n\r\n- Hotfix 1: Fixed the Bigfoot Check having the incorrect Category assigned to it.\r\n- Hotfix 2: Fixed generation failures occurring on earlier Goals with Post-Goal Content disabled.",

      "description": "# Known Issues\r\n- Same generation issue that's plagued this game for a while. Read below for details.\r\n-  #69: Big Fire Ant Check in Chatsanity is barely in the wrong room. My bad. Logically doesn't make a difference, so will probably fix in a later update.\r\n# Changelog\r\n- **The game no longer intentionally fails generation if Disable PostGoal Content is on when your Goal is set to The Pit.**\r\n  - This was being done as a safety measure, but shouldn't be needed anymore.\r\n- Adjusted some hooks related to changing Item classifications and disabling Categories of Items/Checks based on Options.\r\n- Changed the 50 BUX from `Progression` to `Progression (Skip Balancing)`.\r\n  - Also made them get removed from the item pool if the BUX Shop is disabled.\r\n- **Made the Cards found in the BUX Shop have the Chapter 1 Category instead of Prologue, since Prologue disables the BUX Shop anyway.**\r\n- **Made Shopsanity and Cutscenesanity _not_ Options anymore, to make the Manual have more consistent successful generation.**\r\n  - The BUX Shop is still its own Option, however.\r\n  - The generator still has a low chance of failing due to it trying to nicely fit all of the Progression Items before they're needed. Linear games always seem to have this issue, and I'm doing everything I can to fix it, but I genuinely have no idea how to permanently fix it without using something lame like `place_item`.\r\n- Fixed Bomb not being part of Blackrock Castle Region's logic, which may have caused some linear issues. <sub>whoops</sub>\r\n- Added comments explaining some of the code in `hooks/World.py`, for those curious.\r\n- Maybe more that I forgot, I dunno...\r\n# Things to Add\r\n- #18: Add all of the content within Chapter 4. This is on hold until the Chapter 5 + Story Rewrite Update releases sometime in the coming months.\r\n- #68 and #70: Add a couple of missing Chatsanity Checks. Probably gonna wait on this until the next _major_ update since it's somewhat minimal.",

May or may not be used more in the future, depending on what the game adds.\r\n- Renamed `Mango After Defeating Bigfoot X` Checks to `Mango X From Bigfoot's Tree`.\r\n- Renamed the BUX Item's Category from `Shopsanity` to `Shopsanity Currency`, and made sure they will still be removed if Shopsanity is disabled.\r\n- There is a Skeleton Enemy as well as a Skeleton NPC. This caused generation failures from having the same Check name, so they've been slightly renamed to differentiate the two.\r\n- Fixed generation issue regarding renaming the `Wooden Sword from Shedletsky` Check to `Wooden Sword`.",
