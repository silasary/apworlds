      "description": "This is the first playable build for Crash 2 (PAL)\r\nThere are currently no customization options beyond the default template\r\nThe randomization logic assumes you are able to perform speed-run skips (i.e. red gem early, road to ruin box gem early, ruination green gem path without green gem)\r\n\r\n**Checks:**\r\n\r\n- All 25 crystals\r\n- All 42 clear/colored gems\r\n- All 27 level exits + 5 secret exits\r\n- All bosses (excluding Cortex)\r\n\r\n**Item Pool:**\r\n\r\n- 25 crystals (used to unlock the next warp room / boss)\r\n- 37 clear gems (does nothing)\r\n- 5 colored gems (used to unlock colored gem platforms)\r\n- lives (filler item)\r\n\r\n**Goal:**\r\n\r\n- Defeat Dr. Neo Cortex\r\n\r\n**Features:**\r\n\r\n- View your item inventory with the in-game pause menu\r\n- Completed crystal/gem checks show up in the warp room\r\n- Connecting syncs your progress, so if the game crashes you can always start a new save, re-open the client, and connect\r\n\r\n**Known Issues:**\r\n\r\n- Re-opening the client and connecting to a game that was connected crashes the game\r\n- Connecting, then loading a state where the game wasn't connected, and then reconnecting crashes the game",
