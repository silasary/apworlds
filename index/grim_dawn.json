Enabling this means you always get your progress in order, instead of possibly getting unlucky and receiving your progressive items in reverse order\r\n- Added more rare crafting materials to the item pool\r\n- Added slith necklaces as a logical item for the Good Old Slith Charm quest (so enemy rando doesn't rng you from completing it)\r\n- Added Dynamite to the item pool\r\n- Added Inventory Bag to the item pool\r\n- Added a Ashes of Malmouth dlc option\r\n- Lancel the Knight in Devil's Crossing now says what your goal is\r\n\r\nWhat's Changed:\r\n\r\n- Rebalanced the ratio of extra exp, skill points, and filler\r\n- Extra exp instead of granting about 10% of a bar at all levels, now grants about 5% past level 15, and significantly higher at very early levels\r\n- Renamed \"Skill points +4\" to \"Skill Points\" and they now give 2 skill points\r\n- Renamed \"Bloodsworn\" to \"The Bloodsworn Damned\"\r\n- Devotion shrines can all spawn on any difficulty, enabling elite and ultimate runs for greater challenge\r\n\r\nBug Fixes:\r\n\r\n- Updated the mod files to the latest patch for Grim Dawn\r\n- Fixed a backwards compatibility issue\r\n- Fixed several typos including Forgotten Gods \"Stroy\" and \"Hundering\" Darkness\r\n- Fixed Kymon/Vigil quest 6 being in logic without access to east marsh\r\n- Fixed faction revered items not giving you standing unless you already had a bit standing\r\n- Fixed locations added by FG dlc to the main campaign being enabled when FG was disabled\r\n- Made the patching process asynchronous so it doesn't timeout keepalive pings on potato PCs\r\n\r\nGet the poptracker at https://github.com/routhken/Grim_Dawn_tracker/releases/\r\nGet the mod at https://www.nexusmods.com/grimdawn/mods/167",
