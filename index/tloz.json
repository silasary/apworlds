THIS ISN'T YOUR TYPICAL APWORLD INSTALL!**\r\n\r\nNew Features since v1:\r\n- Migrated from a custom client to Bizhawk Client.\r\n- Migrated to APProcedurePatch so rom is no longer needed for generation\r\n- Added in new options for weapon and defense logic.\r\n- Added in Entrance Randomization options.\r\n\r\nNote: since this is an apworld for a currently supported AP game, you will need to backup your old tloz.apworld and replace it with this one. Also, with the transition to using Bizhawk Client, you will need to manually open aptloz patch files with Bizhawk Client, as Archipelago will still try to associate said patches with the old Zelda1 Client until this update is fully merged and released.",
