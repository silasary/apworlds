The races will only be included in entrance shuffle and counted for levels unlocked by keys if coin shuffle is on.\r\n  * Entrance options have been renamed/reduced to just `off`/`on`/`lockmm` to increase clarity. `lockmm` is the same as `on`, but Monkey Madness is forced to be at the final possible entrance.\r\n  * Key options have been reworked to remove race-related options. The existing options have been renamed to `level` and `world` for unlocking 1 level or 1 world at a time. Two new options `none` and `twolevels` have been added, to support no world keys at all, and a setting in between the existing ones.\r\n  * New option \"extra keys\" allows putting extra world keys into the pool.\r\n* **Other additions/changes**\r\n  * The first mailbox in the Time Station will now show useful information about the seed and your progress. This includes things like logic difficulty, required tricks, what locations and items are shuffled, and how many keys and tokens you have/need.\r\n  * Added \"Water Net\" as an option for starting gadget.\r\n  * Added `bh_itemdisplay` command to show received items in Bizhawk, and a YAML option to set the default value of this command.\r\n  * Bugfix: Entrances will now show as complete when their level has all monkeys caught, not when the level originally at that entrance has all monkeys caught. Race levels will show as complete after winning them.\r\n\r\n## Known bugs\r\n* Stadium Attack and Gladiator Attack will usually play the \"entering level\" music instead of their intended track.\r\n* With Lamp Shuffle on, some rooms (like the TV Tower tank room or Dexter's Island boulder area) with lamps can crash randomly. It's advised to make a save before entering these rooms to minimize loss of local progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n**\\*Don't forget to do \"Generate Template Options\" after installing the ``apworld`` if you want the new options in the YAML\\*\r\n(Or use the one in this release)**\r\n\r\nTracker for this apworld version: coming soon?\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/Thedragon005/Archipelago-Ape-Escape/compare/v0.7.3...v0.8.0",
