      "description": "- Trainersanity has been expanded to include event battles (battles with NPCs that disappear after battle). If your inventory is full and you are unable to receive the item, you can get it later by talking to Oak or having your Pok\u00e9dex evaluated at a PC.\r\n- Rock Tunnel is no longer forced to be contiguous for Door Shuffle when Randomize Rock Tunnel Layout is enabled.\r\n- In order to more easily program Pok\u00e9mon location randomization handling, the options to randomize the locations of wild Pok\u00e9mon, static Pok\u00e9mon, and starter Pok\u00e9mon have been condensed to a single option, \"Randomize Pok\u00e9mon Locations.\" \r\n- Pok\u00e9mon placed in static locations are now likely to appear nowhere else.\r\n- Many of what were one-time static Pok\u00e9mon locations are now repeatable. You can now buy the Route 4 Pok\u00e9mon Center Pok\u00e9mon repeatedly, you can perform in-game trades repeatedly, and you can purchase copies of fossils you have turned in at one of the PCs in the Cinnabar Lab Fossil Room. \r\n- Option to cause EXP to not be split between Pok\u00e9mon receiving it, instead granting the full amount to each.\r\n- In-game option for alerts for items received from the Multiworld.\r\n- In-game Auto Run option (hold B to walk at normal speed)\r\n- Battle Style (Shift/Set) and Text Speed are set in the yaml and cannot be changed in-game.\r\n- Catch 'Em All option now works when Randomize Pok\u00e9mon Locations is turned off, making version-exclusives available and making starters and Eevee obtainable repeatedly somewhere.\r\n- Randomize Music option.\r\n- Rods always catch a bite (unless you have no Pok\u00e9mon!)\r\n- Various vanilla game crashes have been patched.\r\n- Prompt to re-use repel items when they wear off.\r\n- More dialogue has been trimmed from the game.\r\n- Box count is displayed when sending a Pok\u00e9mon to it in battle.\r\n- Cinnabar Shore glitch has been patched out due to inconsistencies with vanilla game affecting how Missingno. impacts the game, including game crashes.\r\n- The \"Key Items Only\" option has been removed due to generation failures and difficulty in maintaining code.\r\n- Location Name Groups have been created.",
