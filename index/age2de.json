But for the curious/eager it is here.\r\n\r\nPlace the folders in the zip file into your local Age of Empires II DE steam folder. You can find the folder either by navigating to `C:/Users/<USER>/Games/Age of Empires 2 DE/<STRING_OF_NUMBERS>/` or by opening Age 2 and opening the scenario editor. From there, click \"Open Scenario Folder\" and navigate up in your file explorer to the folder that is a long string of numbers.\r\n\r\nYou will need to also select `C:/Users/<USER>/Games/Age of Empires 2 DE/<STRING_OF_NUMBERS>/` when first running the Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition Client. If you mess this up, it is OK, because there is a command to reselect it.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the folder prompt will need to be selected every time you run the client, but the folder should be already selected in the prompt.\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @Stefrex1 made their first contribution in https://github.com/dmwever/Ageipelago/pull/1\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/dmwever/Ageipelago/commits/0.0.1",
