      "description": "Thanks for all the testing and feedback! You do need to download the apworld again, because the logic has been changed.\r\n\r\nIn this update, logic has been corrected, so `Lot's of footprints` properly requires the train to be fixed.\r\nThanks to feedback, I've also adjusted the size of sphere 1, by locking the Mom, Train, and Wine Buttons behind unlocks as well. (They'll just pop in when they're received.)\r\nI've renamed the Damage Gift Locations to better reflect that they are consecutive goals, rather than an overall number as it was previously.\r\n\r\nI've also added a `glitched` logic setting, which allows for some skips to be considered in logic. (It hasn't been tested as well, because I don't know how to do them.)\r\n\r\n### Instructions\r\n1. Install [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.23.2), the x64 build.\r\n2.

      "description": "Thanks for all the testing and feedback! You do need to download the apworld again, because a missing location was added.\r\n\r\nI fully rewrote the code for the mod to use HarmonyX. This greatly reduces the complexity as well as the file size of the mod itself, as it no long needs the MMHOOK file to be included.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a longstanding vanilla bug has finally been fixed, the Damage Overshoot Bug, in which if you overshoot the damage target, any extra damage is completely lost. Now it carries over!\r\nI've also added the missing `Champagne Time!` location to the AP world, so you will need to update it.\r\n\r\n### Instructions\r\n1.
