When starting in DM's House or Spell Lab and playing with Hotspot Items on, you will need to find a hotspot unique to those starts to leave the area.\r\n- **New Feature: Starter Kits** - With starting locations other than Port Foozle, you will now be granted a starter kit of a few items and hotspots. This is to make it so each starting location has an equally sized sphere 1 (roughly). Each starting location can pick from 5 distinct starter kits.

These were mainly added for the upcoming Zork Tour goal, but also made available as an option to have more locations.\r\n- **New Feature: More Deaths** - When playing with deathsanity on, each unique totemizer death is now its own location. This allows for the other totemizer destinations to become progression items. The total of possible deaths is jumping from 16 -> 22.\r\n- **New Feature: Random Initial Totemizer Destination** - Every new seed starts with a random totemizer destination unlocked.\r\n- **New Option: Hotspots** - Select whether hotspots are all enabled, require an item per region or require an item per hotspot to unlock\r\n- **New Goals** - 4 new goals:\r\n  - `Artifact of Magic Hunt`: Collect the required number of Artifacts of Magic (configurable) and go to the Walking Castle.\r\n  - `Spell Heist`: Collect all spells and go to the signpost outside Port Foozle.\r\n  - `Zork Tour`: Visit landmarks (configurable) and go to the signpost outside Port Foozle.\r\n  - `Grim Journey`: Experience deaths (configurable) and go beyond the gates of hell.\r\n- **17 New Location Checks**\r\n- **New Feature: Thematic Filler Items** - Filler items are now \"scrolls\" selected from a large collection of official spells from the Zork universe. They still do nothing, but might get a chuckle or two from those who see them\r\n- **New Feature: Client Seed Information** - After sending the /zork command in the client, information about the seed (goal, options) will be displayed\r\n- **New Option: Client Seed Information** - Control how much seed information is revealed after /zork: Nothing, Only Goal, Goal + Options\r\n- **New Feature: Client Starter Kit** - After sending the /zork command in the client, the starter kit that was granted to the player will be displayed\r\n- **New Option: Wild VOXAM** - When enabled, a configurable small chance of VOXAM casts will be wild and teleport the player around a different starting location\r\n- **New Feature: Death Link** - :)\r\n- **New Feature: Save Integrity** - A unique ID per slot+seed is now injected when saving while connected to the AP server. When sending the /zork command, the client expects either a new game or for the correct ID to be present in the save file. Opening the wrong save file will no longer send out locations checks or goal.\r\n- **New Feature + Options: Traps** - A percentage of filler items (configurable) can now be replaced with traps. The preferred weight of each trap type can be specified. Traps can only take effect when the player is AFGNCAPP (so nothing will happen as Brog, Griff and Lucy or while under the influence of SNAVIG). The 4 available trap types are:\r\n  - `Infinite Corridor Trap`: Get teleported at a (reasonable) random depth in the infinite corridor in GUE Tech. May offer an opportunity for out-of-logic gameplay.\r\n  - `Reverse Controls Trap`: Panorama controls are reversed for 30 seconds. Static screens are unaffected.\r\n  - `Teleport Trap`: Get teleported somewhere around one of the possible starting locations. May offer an opportunity for out-of-logic gameplay.\r\n  - `ZVision Trap`: Obscured panorama vision for 30 seconds. Static screens are unaffected.\r\n- **New Feature: Energy Link** - Hitting the mushroom with the hammer will add a small amount of energy to the multiworld's energy link pool. More energy is transferred when the mushroom has been THROCKed.\r\n- **New Feature + Options: Entrance Randomizer** - Randomize the destinations of 40 game entrances, either in coupled or uncoupled mode, to create game worlds connected in a unique way every seed. An additional option is also provided to also include the 12 unique subway destinations in the randomization pool.\r\n- **New Feature: Universal Tracker Support** - Universal Tracker will now work correctly with any combination of options, including when using the entrance randomizer. YAML-free Universal Tracker usage is also supported.\r\n- **New Feature: In-Client Tracker** - Added a client tab that tracks available locations, checked locations and received items. The location tracker has a unique feature where it will only show you what's in logic for a game area after you gain access to it in game for the first time. This means you get to use a full-featured tracker without spoiling your entrance randomizer connections before actually traversing the entrances. You can connect to your slot and check received items and remaining locations without needing to open and connect to the game.\r\n- **New Feature: In-Client Entrance Tracker** - Added a client tab that automatically tracks where entrances lead to as you go through them in game when playing with the entrance randomizer. The information is persisted across game sessions.\r\n- **New Feature: In-Client Location Check Guide** - Accessible on the Tracker client tab, clicking the small ? button next to a location name will open a popup describing how to check that location.\r\n#### Other Changes\r\n- **AP Feature Supported: Start Inventory From Pool**\r\n- **AP Feature Supported: Item Link**\r\n- **Notable Changes for Existing Players**\r\n  - https://discord.com/channels/731205301247803413/1224389493289648218/1307355708152483900\r\n- **Bug Fixes**\r\n  - `Make Love, Not War` can now be unlocked from both sides of the River Styx\r\n  - Prevent casting VOXAM during Zork Rocks lockdown (Game scripts do NOT like you leaving GUE Tech)\r\n  - Add a small delay before accessing memory after teleporting to starting location (preventing game crash)\r\n  - Skull cage chess boards now have their hotspot also disabled until the Hotspot: Skull Cage item is received\r\n  - Wait until the Student ID card is back in the inventory before removing it from the inventory\r\n  - Prevent the well rope from being picked up\r\n  - Allow `I'm Not Impressed` (new location check) to be triggered shore-side in Hades. Logic still expects the player to get it across the river\r\n  - Fix cards being visible on first render of the card game",

More recently, Universal Tracker introduced map support that displays locations in PopTracker style while using its own logic capabilities. This release takes advantage of that feature, restoring visual tracking in the classic V1 style while incorporating the new locations from V2, along with starting location and full entrance randomizer support\r\n- **Tweak** - Artifacts of Magic are now classified as Progression Deprioritized + Skip Balancing\r\n- **Tweak** - Spells are now conditionally classified as Progression Deprioritized + Skip Balancing when the goal is Spell Heist\r\n- **Fix** - Generation will no longer leave behind `.puml` files for Zork: Grand Inquisitor in your Archipelago directory\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1251\" height=\"1363\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cf275ea-25fd-432b-88a5-901ea5d22320\" />\r\n",
