As of yet, there's still a lot of cleaning up the code and changes to make, and the actual game mod doesn't exist yet.\r\nIncluded is the .apworld, the default template .yaml, and a manual .apworld for use with the [Manual Client](https://github.com/ManualForArchipelago/Manual/releases/tag/manual_stable_20240709).\r\n\r\nPlace the .apworld(s) in your Archipelago/custom_worlds/ folder, place .yamls in the /Players/ folder, and generate.\r\n\r\nTo change the player name for the Manual world, you can edit the files directly or upload it to [Manual Builder](https://manualforarchipelago.github.io/ManualBuilder/) and change it there.",
