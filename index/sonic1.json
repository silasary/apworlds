Should now be fixed permanently.\r\n- Test cases added to check that the host can actually generate worlds using the options available.\r\n\r\nI believe this world is now stable and has all the functionality needed, please do test and let me know if I've missed anything.  I have confirmed the world is clearable.\r\n\r\nThe one outstanding change, if nothing else comes up, will be adding an easier link to the poptracker pack, once I'm more certain of where it will live.",

Emerald, boss and special counts can now be lowered from 6.\r\n- An advanced option to allow Final Zone to be the final zone played, for those desiring thematic logic.\r\n- Per discord suggestion, the 6 specific Special Stage keys have been replaced by a progressive unlock version using 6 copies of a generic special's key.  No more waiting for SS1 key.\r\n- Some extra visibility has been added to tell the ROM that you finished the AP.\r\n- For extra polish, remote collection of monitors will now show on the select screen like it does on the tracker.  I can't promise this will be as good as the real trackers, but it works as a quick guide. \r\n- The log will now suppress the repeating of the seed mismatch message, only showing if it changes.\r\n- A basic use of Bizhawk display message has been added.  Really basic.  But you can see AP messages now.\r\n- Fixed early activation of powerups sent when not in levels.\r\n- Got rid of the redundant apworld in the apworld.\r\n\r\nPer discord request, the following item name groups have been added: emeralds, powerups.  This adds to the previously defined groups: keys, rings and junk.\r\nPer discord request, the following location name groups have been added: monitors, bosses, specials\r\nPer discord suggestion, a proper sound effect now exists for the R special stage block\r\nIt was noted that Hard Mode's completion check was broken.  Oops.  Amazed I missed that for so long.\r\n\r\nI'd like to say this is done for now... but if I say that someone will find another annoying bug.  Chekov's release notes.",

      "description": "Update: Minor hotfix, this version shouldn't crash on slots over 255.  Limit is 32k now.  - 2025/09/02\r\n\r\nThe save data formats and generation are the same as the previous release, so this is safe to mix with Sonic 1 v0.1.0 seeds.\r\n\r\nSome minor changes:\r\n\r\n- Fix an error not clearing progressive/consumable item counts when PopTracker connects\r\n- Set `explicit_indirect_conditions = False` to fix hopefully all the gen failures fuzzer found\r\n- Only publish a change to map_code 0 (the menu) when we actually switch to the title screen, should fix spurious transitions\r\n- Bruteforce the access rules so poptracker knows about the sequence break\r\n\r\nROM updated with following changes:\r\n- Uses the old demotimer to periodically rerender the level select.  Not perfectly real time but it will reflect changes from AP in seconds at most.\r\n- No longer activate a powerup if there is a value in sound queue one.  This fixes a race condition between processing the message from the end of a powerup and trying to queue the start of the next one.  No more invinc/speed shoe conflicts.\r\n- Since the refreshing caused flickers occasionally, I've partially rewritten the text rendering.  Now uses pascal-style length prefixed strings (so no more manually specifying lengths) and handles the yellow line highlight mostly inline with the rendering.  Overall much better\r\n- If you try to enter a level that doesn't exist or is locked out by a progression gate, a sound effect now plays.",
