      "description": "# v0.2.0 Armored Core (PSX) APworld\r\n\r\n## New in this version\r\n- Shopsanity - When enabled this option shuffles all Parts into the multiworld (other than starting and dummy parts). All shop listings unlock as missions are completed based on settings and now contain multiworld items! The Parts names in the shop are the item names, but hitting Triangle to pull up the description will tell you the Player Name, Item Name and what Classification it is (Filler, Useful, Progression, Trap). New shop unlocks always hint the items within. No selling parts in this mode! Brings Locations amount up to about 215.\r\n- Bonus Credits Adjustment - You can now set how many credits you get from filler Credit checks.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- All Mail locations can now be accessed properly in Progressive Missions Mode.\r\n- Unlocks from completing Missions now happen earlier in the menu loading process than before for better client responsiveness.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n- The Missions Menu / Shop Menu (when shopsanity is on) sometimes need a moment to structure themselves properly, hover over it for a second before entering or exit and re-enter to get the properly constructed mission selection options. Failing to do so for the Mission Menu can rarely result in a crash.\r\n- If in the shop a Parts description is completely blank, try hitting Triangle a few more times or moving between entries. This is a Bizhawk issue.\r\n- When Shopsanity is on, Hidden Parts can be obtained either by someone sending the part to you or picking it up in the level its in. Once the Hidden Part appears in the shop as a check to be sold however, it will no longer appear in its normal level anymore.\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes and Setup Guide\r\nhttps://github.com/JustinMarshall98/Armored-Core-PSX-Archipelago/tree/main/docs",

      "description": "# v0.3.0 Armored Core (PSX) APworld\r\n\r\n## New in this version\r\n- Starting AC Randomization! With this setting on the AC you generate with at the beginning of the game in the Raven's Test will be random (but still a valid AC).\r\n- Added a manifest file to make the apworld compatible with future versions of Archipelago.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- When Shopsanity is off, shop locations are no longer generated for the game. You can now safely play with this option off.\r\n- When Human+ upgrades are not shuffled into the pool the game no longer fails to generate. You can now safely play with this option off.\r\n- The Missionsanity Goal Location (Armored Core Goal) now properly has its name associated with itself.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n- The client is generally a bit sluggish in the menu.\r\n- The Missions Menu / Shop Menu (when shopsanity is on) sometimes need a moment to structure themselves properly, hover over it for a second before entering or exit and re-enter to get the properly constructed mission selection options. Failing to do so for the Mission Menu can rarely result in a crash.\r\n- If in the shop a Parts description is completely blank, try hitting Triangle a few more times or moving between entries. This is a Bizhawk issue.\r\n- When Shopsanity is on, Hidden Parts can be obtained either by someone sending the part to you or picking it up in the level its in. Once the Hidden Part appears in the shop as a check to be sold however, it will no longer appear in its normal level anymore.\r\n- If you try to start yourself with a part from your pool and you have randomized starting ac on, if you luck into starting with that part your world may fail to generate properly. Try generating again until this doesn't happen. (The same is true for trying to start yourself off with one of the normal starting parts if your starting ac is not randomized).\r\n- In some cases, selling an equipped optional part will keep it equipped until you open the optional parts menu.\r\n- It is likely impossible to randomly generate with tank legs to start the game right now.\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes and Setup Guide\r\nhttps://github.com/JustinMarshall98/Armored-Core-PSX-Archipelago/tree/main/docs",
